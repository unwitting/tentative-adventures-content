# Laos part 2: Kuang Si and Nong Khiaw

In the second half of our time in Laos we ditched the cities for some time in the countryside.

### Kuang Si Waterfalls

A popular day trip from Luang Prabang, the Kuang Si waterfalls are pretty stunning. Most visitors only spend an afternoon strolling around the falls and pools, but we have time in abundance so decided to stay for three nights.

The hotel we stayed at, which is the only one in the area, is located on the falls - although outside of the national park boundaries. Whilst there's not really enough to do to occupy three days worth of time, sitting and reading with this view kept us happy:

Unfortunately, on our first night at the hotel we had a bit of a misunderstanding, resulting in us accidentally buying a three course meal when we'd already had dinner... but hey ho, these things happen.

Anyway, on to the falls. We decided to head up on our first full day in the area. It cost 20000 kip each to enter, which is about Â£1.75, and included a visit to the bear sanctuary at the bottom.

The moon bears in the sanctuary had been rescued from bile farms, which harvest bear bile to be used in traditional medicines. The bears are often illegally poached, and then kept alive in poor conditions while the bile is harvested. It was a pretty small reserve, but very informative.

Not much chat is required about the walk up and around the fall, so here's some pictures:

The reason the water is so blue is because it has been filtered through limestone on its way down the mountain. Because of this, you shouldn't really drink much of it or else you'll get..

Once at the top we decided to follow some signs we'd seen that pointed to a cave nearby and in the opposite direction to the one we'd climbed up. The cave itself was pretty boring, the walk there, and the roundabout path that we then took to the village, was lovely.

After what ended up being a very long walk we were very hungry and so sat ourselves down in one of a handful of street side restaurants at the main entrance of the park. It was here that we had the best meal of all time. Big strips of pork belly, lightly brushed with a soy sauce marinade, cooked over a coal BBQ. A small, spatchcocked chicken cooked in the same way. Papaya salad. Steamed rice. And man alive, it was delicious.

To verify that we didn't just love it because we were so hungry from walking, we went back the next day and had the very same thing. It was still just as delicious. For the rest of my time in Laos I ate a diet of 90% belly pork.

There was one other attraction in the area that we visited during our stay: the butterfly garden. This small, netted garden was a little expensive to enter but was well worth it. In some of my posts about Thailand I mentioned that the bugs were massive, and Laos was the same. The garden had 30 or so varieties of butterflies, as well as a huge range of tropical flowers. It was lovely to sit on one edge overlooking the mountains, basking in the sun whilst the butterflies hovered around our head.

### Nong Khiaw

After a day back in Luang Prabang, we then headed up to a small village called Nong Khiaw. I'd heard that there was an amazing view point there, and that seemed as good a reason as any to drive 4 hours over crappy roads into the middle of nowhere.

The view from our hotel balcony

The town itself was fairly small and not yet a hugely popular tourist destination, presumably because of the time it takes to get that far north. However, there are obvious signs of growth, particularly in residential areas where the corrugated iron houses that appear all over Laos are being supplanted by much grander affairs.

It was completely stunning. I have never been somewhere like that before, and even though it was only a couple of weeks ago it already seems like a dream. The pictures below don't do it justice at all, but here you go anyway:

We only had one full day in Nong Khiaw, so we started early with an amble north out of the village. We headed towards the cave that had been used by locals as a bomb shelter when the CIA were going mad with their cluster bombs, as described in my previous post.

On our way there we got a little lost in a meadow, where we were passed by a troop of young boys, probably no older than 8, who all looked very serious about their exploration. One by one they all greeted us politely, before carrying on towards their destination.

After passing them, we also came across a group of girls, conducting some less serious-faced exploration. One of them gave me a small bunch of wild flowers as we passed.

I suspect this was a bribe as I'd just seen her swinging a giant machete through the undergrowth, which she probably shouldn't have been doing. I'm no rat though.

After the caves, and after the morning mist had cleared, we walked up to the viewpoint. There were lots of signs warning us to stay on the path or else be blown up by unexploded mines so obviously we listened to that. The climb was not without event though, because I thought I was going to die from heat exhaustion/ tiredness/ being a wimp at least 80000 times. Jack's contractually obliged to put up with my shit now though so we managed to get to the top in the end, and actually in pretty good spirits.

This is what we saw:

In all, I loved Laos but I was ready to leave when we did. The people were incredibly friendly (and especially the children), the pork was delicious, and the views were stunning. But, although I haven't touched on it here, the lack of certain things gets quite tiring after a while. It also forces you to reflect on your luckiness in being able to notice that lack. You can read 1001 hackneyed "people have less than I do and that gives me feels" posts on other travel logs so I'll save you from another here.

All I'll say is that Laos delighted me, challenged me, informed me, and saddened me.
