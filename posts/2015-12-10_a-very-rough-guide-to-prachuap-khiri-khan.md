# A very rough guide to Prachuap Khiri Khan

Welcome to Prachuap Khiri Khan, the undisputed king of coconut-pineapple-and-monkey towns in Thailand.

Go to the pictures

Prachuap, or ประจวบคีรีขันธ์, is a beautiful little seaside town a little bit (in fact not far off 300km, but in Thai terms not that far) down the coast from Bangkok. It's warm, it's very friendly and it is largely left alone by non-Thai tourists. Probably best avoided if you like action-packed holidays, but if you enjoy stunning beaches, fantastic seafood and a relaxed pace of life then it's for you. If you haven't got long in Thailand and you'll be based in Bangkok, it has the benefit of being easily reachable in under half a day by train.

## Sand and sea, or "Ao do you like them beaches?"

Let's start with the beaches; they're the attention grabbers. The main town front on the sea is a large concrete promenade along Ao Prachuap (this "Ao" means "bay" in Thai), with a long pier out into the water. This pier is often really empty and a great place to go, sit and observe the bay in peace. However, the sand on Ao Prachuap is only really a few metres wide and it isn't really used for swimming.

That's not the only beach connected to the town though; it actually sits on a stretch of coast that's serrated with almost semi-circular bays, joined by the characteristic green stack hills that you see all over Thailand. The next one along to the south from the main town is called Ao Manao ("Lime Bay") and is a different thing entirely. A popular tourist destination with Thais, this place has a wide, sweeping beach with clear sands and beautiful islands on the horizon. It's long enough to be able to find a near empty spot even on the weekend but well catered for by seafront food halls and shower / toilet blocks.

Getting to Ao Manao is a little involved, but entirely worth it. The thing is, it sits inside Royal Thai Air Force land (specifically that of Wing Division 53, who maintain a presence and airstrip on the land between the two bays). More on the military in Prachuap later, but for now suffice to say that however you travel the few kilometres from town to Ao Manao, you'll need to stop off at the Air Force office on the road there to sign in with your passport number. It's a little bit of a formality, and the locals straight up don't do it, but good to do things right. You're also supposed to sign out when you leave, but not every tuktuk driver is created equal in terms of shits given about it, and good luck communicating to them mid-drive that you need to stop for that. Anyway, you get to drive clean across their airstrip during the journey which is always neat. Another upside of all this hassle is that the land is kept in pretty tip-top shape and cleanliness by the Air Force, which only adds to Ao Manao's loveliness.

## The Battle of Prachuap Khiri Khan

This was a pretty key point in Thailand's involvement in World War II. In early December 1941 a battalion of the Imperial Japanese Army appeared without warning and began to land at Prachuap Khiri Khan, intending to use it as a base for the occupation of Thailand, itself so that they could attack British assets in neighbouring countries. You can read a pretty detailed account of how it all went down on Wikipedia, but essentially the very small and unprepared Thai Air Force presence and a group of the local police put up a pretty powerful defense, despite largely being wiped out eventually. Afterwards, Thailand joined with Japan in alliance to prevent similar attacks. The town holds a memorial to the defense every year around the anniversary on the Air Force base, and there are various plaques detailing the bravery of the police force around the town.

It wasn't just the imperial Japanese that saw strategic value in Prachuap's location though; it's plenty close enough to neighbouring Myanmar and to Bangkok to strike / aid as necessary, and so the RTAF are stationed there now just as they were back then.

## Climb a hill, see some monkeys

Back to being a tourist in Prachuap. Monkeys are everywhere in Thailand, but this town has excelled itself in terms of sheer concentration. On the northern end of Ao Prachuap, right behind the town hall, is the start of a set of 396 steps. These climb all the way up a hill called Khao Chong Krachok, at the top of which is Wat Thammikaram, the "Monkey Temple". As you climb you get to see why. Each step roughly doubles the number of monkeys in your range of vision. When we visited it was a little nervy walking on and on through the increasing monkey density; a few of them manage to make themselves seem downright threatening (to be fair though, 95% of them just really really want to hear what it sounds like when you bash two stones together in a puddle). But these don't really seem to be the steal-your-wallet-scratch-your-face monkeys you hear about in a lot of places, and in fact the locals happily feed them nuts and bananas out of bags every day.

Make it to the top, and not only are you now legally authorised to ask the Prachuap tourist office for a certificate proclaiming you "Conqueror of Khao Chong Krachok", but you're treated to an incredible view. In one direction, you see down the multiple bays of the coastline around the town, and the many small islands dotted in the sea nearby. In another, miles of striking farmland finishing off in a mountain range covering the horizon. These mountains in fact conceal the Thai-Burmese border, which is only 11km away; Prachuap sits on the thinnest part of the country (not the thinnest point of the peninsular, which is a little further south).

## And...

I mentioned seafood. Many Prachuapians fish for a living and the town's restaurants and food stalls almost all serve some kind of fish or shellfish. We had one Tom Yum in particular made with hands down the best shrimp I've ever eaten.

Another highlight (which we unfortunately didn't get time to visit - it's a little way to the north of the town by car) is Phraya Nakhon cave. This cave comprises two large chambers, both with rooves open to the sunlight (so you get that cool, mysterious, Tomb Raider vibe) and the larger of the two contains the Kuha Karuhas, a little golden pavilion built right inside the cave in the 1800's for a visit by King Rama V. It's certainly pretty magical and worth the drive and climb if you have the time, by all accounts.

Prachuap is a largely unspoilt little gem on the way down the peninsular to more well-known Gulf Coast resorts and islands, and it's truly worth stopping there for a day on your way if you have the time and enjoy the slower, friendlier things in life.
