# Trekking Khao Yai National Park

After a couple of weeks in Chiang Mai we've been exploring the North East region of Thailand, Isaan. It's an area that's often left out of short holidays to the country (or so every article/ blog post/ guide about the place would have you believe), and is the largest region in the country.

Over the past week and a half we've slowly made our way up through Isaan, and will be crossing over the Mekong to Laos on the 24th January.

## Khao Yai National Park

Our first stop in this region was Khao Yai national park, just a couple of hours north east of Bangkok. We travelled there from Chiang Mai on the sleeper train, which was AMAZING! It was like a huge, moving sleepover with 100 or so strangers. I got very little sleep, partly because a monk and a guard were having a very loud conversation right near my head, and partly because I was too excited be being on a train bed.

At the national park we stayed at a hostel called Greenleaf, which we chose because it offers well reviewed guided treks of the national park. We booked into the afternoon trek on the day we arrived, and the full day trek the following day. Man alive was I exhausted by the end.

The afternoon tour was billed as a visit to a spring and a cave, followed by watching bats at sunset. All of this took place just outside the national park.

The spring was, well, spring-y. It wasn't hot, but it was beautifully clear.  Jack jumped in, because he's essentially a fish. I did not. Whilst we were there our tour guide showed us some of the local wildlife, including a snake, which I was happy to be up close with, and a huge spider, which I was not.

After the spring went to a cave where we saw some of the freakiest shit. Guys, bugs that live in caves are weird.

The cave that we visited is on the grounds of a temple, and contains a shrine that's maintained by the  monks. The cave itself is mainly made of volcanic rock, which looked a lot like fossilised wood (or what I imagine fossilised wood would look like), and sounded hollow when you tapped it.

Sorry for the photo quality, caves are not conducive to good photos.

We were led deeper into the cave by our very knowledgeable tour guide, who taught us about bat habits, whilst his assistant mysteriously vanished into another corner of the cave. Turns out she was searching for the above mentioned freaky bugs.

For example:

If this looks familiar, it's probably because you've watched Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. This is a scorpion spider, and they're what Mad Eye Moody used to demonstrate the unforgivable curses:

Look at it! I thought it was some freaky CGI thing they'd made for the film, but nope, is real. 10/10 would avada kedavra.

Also:

Yeah. I was not on board with this at all. I'd held a snake earlier in the day. Snakes are fine, they're silky and move in a delightful way. Your creepies and your crawlies, well they creep and they crawl. Ugggh.

Anywho, we ventured around the cave, at one point all turning our lights off and keeping really still so that we could hear the bats going about their business, and get a sense of what the cave was like when people weren't there. Until some absolute muggins  tried to walk around. In the pitch black. And, inevitably fell over and hurt their leg (not badly, I'm sure they were fine really).

After the cave, we drove for about 10 minutes to a tapioca farm so that we could see the entrance to a different cave. We couldn't go inside because it's privately owned and used as a guano farm, with around 2 million bats living inside. Originally, the guano farmed here was used for fertilisers, as it's plentiful and high in nitrates. However, now it's mainly used for gunpowder, because reasons, and the guy who owns the cave makes a bit of a killing from it.

We arrived as the sun began to set, watching as the bats streamed from the mouth of the cave and then danced in a stream around the air currents.

The following day we spent 10 hours in the national park, driving around to try and catch glimpses of wild elephants and gibbons, walking through the jungle to get to a series of waterfalls, and generally marvelling at both the wildlife and the scenery.

A heads up before we continue - wildlife photography is hard. Whilst we took a fair few pictures of animals, they had to be abandoned because they were generally shoddy.

Two long tail macaques. These monkeys were very brazen, and enjoyed using the cars in the car park as an obstacle course.

Part way into the longest walk it absolutely tipped it down and despite the thick tree cover we got drenched. After about 10 mins of rainfall our guide somewhat reluctantly handed out rain ponchos, which were pretty redundant by then.

Although we didn't get to see any elephants in the end, we still saw and learned about quite a range of wildlife.

My favourite part, though, was the drive back through the park after we had finished our hike. We changed altitude quite a bit and were dipping in and out of mist, as the sun began to set. The views were incredible.

So, an awesome couple of days!

Our tour guide took this through his telescope, hence the quality and the strange vignette

Helpful sign pointing out what we could see from our mountain top viewpoint...

So, these bins were at the top of the mountain (behind the sign in the photo above. The bin second from the right is for toxic waste only. Seems legit.
