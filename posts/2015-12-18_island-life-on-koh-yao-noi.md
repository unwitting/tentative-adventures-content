# Island life on Koh Yao Noi

Last week Jack and I spent eight nights on the island of Koh Yao Noi, just off the Andaman coast.

We’d sketched plans to head to the south of Thailand for some of our first month here, but hadn’t decided on where. We’re not really full moon party types, and really just wanted somewhere quiet, relatively tourist free, with hammocks and beaches.

Our guidebook described Koh Yao Noi in almost exactly those terms. It doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page.

The island is just on the edge of the Phang Nga national park which incorporates a mangrove swamp on the edge of Phukhet and a load of karst islands in the bay. One of these is the so called “James Bond Island” which was the setting for Scaramanga’s base in The Man with the Golden Gun.

It has the highest average cost for hotels per night of any island in Thailand. Although, that’s mainly because there are two resorts that cost approximately all of your money to stay at. We rented a small, garden view bungalow at Sabai Corner which was lovely and also cheap.

After not too long on the island, we grew accustomed to the natural rhythms that shaped each day: the tide coming in and out every 12.5 hours, the insanely loud cicada chorus at 6pm, the lightning that always started at 7, the torrential rain at 8. All interwoven with the prayer calls from the local mosque. It was lovely.

### Bug's life

One downside of staying on a tropical island is the quantity of creepy crawlies. My god were there some massive bugs. Luckily I didn’t see any spiders, or else I would have left immediately, but I saw just enough of everything else to keep me awake at night. Most of the time we were surrounded by moths as big as your head, giant millipedes, very hungry red ants (they found Jack’s ankle particularly delicious), mosquitos, snakes, frogs, crickets, crabs, bats, geckos, and the list goes on.

I think we got pretty zen about it by the end. Ish.

### Kayaking to Koh Nok

Towards the end of our stay we decided to haul ourselves out of the hammock and do a bit of paddling around the karst islands that lined the horizon.

You can hire a long tail boat to take you and your kayaks to various parts of the bay, but we decided to rent a kayak from our hotel and paddle straight out to the nearest island. After lifting the boat into the water, I jumped in first. Now, my logic here was that, being 6ft 4, Jack was best placed to push the boat out from the rocks before getting in. This turned out to be a mistake.

Immediately after I got into the boat, Jack somehow lost one of the flip flops he was wearing. After 30 seconds of unsuccessful hunting we / I decided to abandon it to the sea gods and Jack jumped into the kayak.

Except, he didn't. Instead he put all of his weight onto one edge of the boat, capsizing it and me. The upside was that in the commotion we found the lost flip flop (turns out they float). The downside was that I cut my foot on the rocks, and turned into a rage monster.

It was my fault really. As Jack later pointed out (after, sensibly, letting me cool off), I'm the boatsman in this relationship. And the more stable generally (in terms of balance, not mood or, well, anything else). I should have known better.

Anyway, we righted the boat, and I steadied it as Jack got in. Then, in one fluid movement, I pushed the kayak away from the rocks and got in, barely unsettling it from its upright position.

In a huff, I instigated a count so that our paddling was in time, and I have to say we made it to Koh Nok at a fantastic pace.

It’s pretty hard to stay grumpy when faced with a semi-private, forest-y beach, so I didn’t try.

### Walking the island

One thing that we’ve noticed in Thailand generally is that locals seem to assume you never want to walk anywhere particularly far. I don’t know if this is to do with the heat, or the fact that most paths are taken up by stalls of various kinds, or if it’s not true at all, but when we decided to walk around the southern part of Koh Yao Noi we didn’t pass a single other walker.

We originally intended to spend the day cycling around the island, but decided to just press on with walking when we couldn’t find any bikes to rent. I’m glad we did, because it meant that we had more time to stop and look at various things, take pictures, and allow ourselves to be detoured up paths that would be difficult to navigate on a bike.

One such path was pointed out to us by a sign pointing towards “sunset mountain”. It was still a few hours until dusk, but we decided to follow it anyway. At first, it led us through a small rubber tree forest, which was being used to farm latex. As the path rose, we started to get spectacular views, not only of Koh Yao Noi, but of the whole bay. Anticipating pretty epic scenes at the top, and a promised restaurant where we might get some water, we pressed on.

As we did, we started to hear drumming, which got louder the higher up we climbed. When we escaped the forest, the trees stopped muffling the sound, and our final steps to the summit were accompanied by a very loud, pretty good rendition of Enter Sandman being played by a local band somewhere near by. We tried to get a recording of it that we could post here, but the sound didn’t come out very well. Never mind. It was a pretty perfect accompaniment to the otherwise serene view.

### The best thing about Koh Yao Noi

It’s the ice-cream based desserts. I don’t have photographic evidence, because who's thinking about photography when faced with a load of ice-cream? Not me. But, I had two pretty fucking epic deserts. I’ll describe them.

The first was at a restaurant called La Luna at the northern tip of the beach we visited most. It was called Chocolate Paradise. It came in a huge, thin glass and consisted of layers of brownie, meringue, chocolate sauce and chocolate ice-cream, topped with whipped cream. The waitress laughed at me when she placed it at the table, presumably because I was making the same face most people would make if they won the lottery. It was fantastic.

The second was at a danish-run restaurant called Rice Paddy which, as the name suggests, overlooks a rice paddy, complete with water buffalo and mosquitos. I can’t even remember what it was called, but the owner warned me that it was pretty big when I ordered it, so Jack and I decided to share (in hindsight this was completely unnecessary - I could have eaten the whole thing easily). It took the waiter ages to make, which I took as a good sign. It had cherry, white chocolate and dark chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, cashew nuts and brownie pieces soaked in an alarming amount of brandy.

The weight that I lost during our time in Bangkok has had a glorious homecoming.

This doesn't adequately capture the size of this butterfly/moth. It was massive.
