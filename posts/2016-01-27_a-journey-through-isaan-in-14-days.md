# A journey through Isaan in 14 days

As I mentioned in my previous post we've been making our way through Isaan for the past two weeks. We pretty much stuck to the main road that goes north through the region, stopping at three towns along the way.

## Khon Kaen

Khon Kaen is the provincial capital of the area, and we mainly decided to head here so that we could get ourselves a visa for Laos. That turned out to be pretty easy, but luckily it's a pretty nice place so we were happy to have several days there.

Getting to Khon Kaen came with the realisation that we were getting off the usual tourist trail, as the ubiquitous English translations on signs disappeared and the strange looks we got increased. We decided to get the bus from Khao Yai, which would mean a change somewhere along the way. Our guesthouse dropped us at the bus station, and we fairly easily got onto the first bus.

When we arrive at our crossover point, though, things got a little tricky. Without the English we'd come to rely on at train and bus stations, we blundered our way over to what looked like an information desk and started speaking to the most official looking person there. She looked at us blankly, giggled and then gestured for us to sit down before disappearing. As we were starting to get a little worried, she returned with another official in tow, who had a very small amount of English.

We were led to the correct window, and paid a sum of money after our minder spoke a string of Thai to the lady behind the counter. We were then placed on some chairs and instructed not to move. Twenty minutes later a different person came over and gestured for us to follow, leading us to our bus seats. I once flew from Spain to England as an unaccompanied minor and the experience was uncannily similar.

In Khon Kaen we spent most of our time in a very relaxed state, eating amazing food and drinking coffee in lovely cafes.

The town has very few tourists, and only a handful of expats. This is a shame and a blessing: it's a place worth visiting, but it's probably especially nice because there's very little that explicitly caters to a western crowd.

A favourite spot for our wanderings was the large lake that dominates the south west of town, which is a hive of activity throughout the day. Many locals appear to use it as a place of exercise, from old people power walking around the path, to kitted out cyclists, and large group exercises. It is lined on one side with large hot pot and bbq restaurants, and includes a huge tiered wat on the other.

The wat, Nong Wang, has a small cultural museum on some of the floors, containing stories about the founding of the city as well as ancient artefacts. Some of the murals were pretty mad without any explanatory text, especially the ones that appeared to trace the story of this murderous guy:

Like other the other temples we've visited in Thailand, it had thousands of intricate details one every surface that could be carved or painted.

The best part about this wat, though, was the view it offered of the city when you climbed to the top level.

Also next to the lake was a small park, which we were strolling around when we came across this guy:

OH HAI!

Not far from Khon Kaen is a place called Dinosaur land (!) which is built on the site of an archeological dig where the oldest dinosaur skeleton in the world was found in 1976 (the geologist who found it was looking for uranium at the time). The dig site has been preserved and a number of exhibitions have been erected, making it into one of the must see attractions in the area.

Despite the awesome name, we didn't visit Dinosaur land in the end, but we did enjoy spotting the various dino statues and topiaries around town.

This dinosaur mosaic was on one of the tiers of Nong Wang

We ate some pretty mediocre Japanese food in Khon Kaen (where they appear to be obsessed with the cuisine), but it's also where we had one of the best dishes we've eaten so far. Just next to our hotel was a family ran street food restaurant, which served crispy pork that was so crispy it can only have been made with witchcraft. When the waitress asked if we wanted a fried egg on top we were like, obvs yes please add that immediately.

I don't think I've put any pictures up of this before: huge pictures of the King are everywhere in Thailand. At night, this one lit up and had music...

There was a surprising amount of construction going on in Khon Kaen, as well as a number of derelict buildings. This was opposite our hotel.

## Udon Thani

Oh, Udon Thani. It's probably the only place in Thailand that we haven't really liked. I think there were two issues, one to do with us, and one with Udon Thani.

Firstly, it doesn't take long for Jack and I to get pretty grumpy about moving every 3/4 days. Udon Thani was the third place in a row that we were staying for only a couple of days and it didn't put us in a great frame of mind.

Secondly, it was very farang orientated. At least, in some parts.

When we get to a new place, especially if we arrive by train, we try to walk to our hotel. This lets us get an immediate flavour of wherever we are, and see more than we would if we got a taxi. We usually get a fair share of odd looks as we sweat through the town in the mid-day heat, but it's a good way to spark our interest in what the place has to offer.

Unfortunately, in Udon Thani the first thing you see when you leave the train station is 101 farang men, often changed by the Thai sun to something that looks more cooked gammon than man. Not a problem in itself, but a lot of the bars and restaurants in that area are clearly aimed at this clientele. My skin colour may resemble theirs, my tastes do not.

This area isn't reflective of the town as a whole, but it coloured our first impressions in a way that only added to our grumpiness.

When we arrived at our hotel we decided to order a pizza. It. Was. Glorious. So cheesy. It eradicated my grumpiness (almost). The next day I had an insane cheese hangover which I think was worth it, but reminded me of when I got back from China all those years ago and felt sick after a single bite of a cheese sandwich. RIP me and dairy.

The best part about Udon Thani was the medium size lake in the south east of the town. Like Khon Kaen, this seemed to be where many of the local inhabitants came to exercise, socialise and eat.

On one edge of the lake there was a Chinese ancestral shrine, and a museum dedicated to the history of the local Chinese population. It was pretty interesting, more because of the implied local politics within the Thai-Chinese community than because of the actual content of the museum.

Much of the building had been funded by one man, who had an entire exhibition dedicated to him. This included an outline of the key morals that he lived by (and recommended you do too), which included a sentence along the lines of: "He has been blessed with good fortune in business because of his generous donations".

## Nong Khai

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/uccgzohb6urdmrh/IMG_9553.EDIT.JPG?dl=0)

Nong Khai is a 30 min train journey away from Udon Thani, and sits on the Mekong across from the Laos capital Vientiane. It's a fairly sleepy little town, but is incredibly relaxing and we had a lot of fun here.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/v89qgdlaqexu96f/IMG_9562.JPG?dl=0)

This huge Naga statue was being re-painted whilst we were there. Monks for scale.

We stayed in a very popular guesthouse that sat right on the river, which meant that at night we got to watch the sun set over the Mekong whilst sipping very cheap gin and tonic. Delight.

Whilst in Nong Khai we met up with a couple of Jack's Dad's friends who live in a nearby town further west up the river. They took us on a whirlwind day of eating and sightseeing. We went to several temples, most of which had amazing views of Laos, as well as to their home.

Most of all, though, we ate. It was amazing to see such tiny women out-do Jack's ability to eat. I was very impressed. And also very full.





Although our sightseeing day was, thankfully, warm and sunny, the other days in Nong Khai were surprisingly rainy and cold - it got down to 17 degrees at one point! Because of this we didn't venture too far, instead spending time strolling the riverfront promenade and drinking cheap gin and tonic.

On Saturday night, our final one in Thailand, there was a night market which had lots of nice snacking food, and a number of dance and music acts.
