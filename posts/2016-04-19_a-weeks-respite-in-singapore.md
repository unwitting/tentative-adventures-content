# A week's respite in Singapore

On a whim we decided to take a trip down to Singapore after a week in Georgetown. We hadn't planned to go originally because we just sort of forgot we could.

First of all, please take a look at this bus:

It had 12 seats, each with so much legroom even Jack could flail around without hitting his knees, a TV with films and games, plus lunch and coffee. It was the best transport ever.

Crossing into Singapore



Second of all, Singapore is awesome. I drank the Kool Aid right up.

I think the best way to describe Singapore is that it's the city every major Western city wishes it was. By which I mean it's wealthy, shiny, green, clean, and full of hipstery coffee, food and beer. It's incredibly expensive though.

In all, Singapore gave us a bit of respite from the unknown: we lived a week much closer to the weekends of our pre-traveling life and felt pretty rejuvenated for it.

## Coffee and food

We drank a whole lot of coffee and ate a whole lot of food and it was all hella good.

## ArtScience Museum

The ArtScience Museum is hands down the best museum we've been to this trip, maybe ever. Science museums are always awesome, but what's interesting about this one is that it focuses on the intersection of art and science.

We went to the Future World installation which is the product of a collaboration with teamLab, a Tokyo based digital art collective made up of artists, programmers, engineers, CG animators, mathematicians, architects and designers.

The exhibition contains 15 art installations separated into four sections: Nature, Town, Park and Space. Most of the installations were responsive to the input of visitors. For example, one of my favourite installations was a huge wall on which was projected symbols representing water, fire, trees, grass, the sun, the moon and various animals falling from top to bottom. When you touched the wall on one of the symbols an image of whatever it represented sprouted from the location of your hand. Pressing many in quick succession created scenes where the different elements interacted.

My favourite installation was the Crystal Universe. This installation took up the entirety of the "Space" section and consisted of an arrangement of strung up lights and mirrors that visitors could stand in. The lights came on in different configurations representing parts of space / the experience of being in space. What I liked the most about this was that when you were inside the lights it was beautiful but hard to make sense of. Once you emerged on the other side and could watch the display from the outside the patterns became clear, and the whole installation took on a different feel. It was stunning.

## Supertree grove

If you've ever seen a picture of Singapore, it has included the Supertrees.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cr8e1gw8073y725/IMG_1344.jpg?dl=0)

I thought they were going to be a little tacky, but I was actually sort of taken with them in the end. The trees range in height between 25 metres (82 ft) and 50 metres (160 ft). They're vertical gardens on which a huge range of tropical plants and plants grow. The technologies within them are designed to mimic the ecological function of trees – photovoltaic cells that harness solar energy which can be used for some of the functions of the Supertrees, such as lighting, and collection of rainwater for use in irrigation and fountain displays. They also serve air intake and exhaust functions as part of the nearby conservatories' cooling systems.

They have a light show at 8pm every day. When we were there it was set to various Disney songs and some classical music. It was awesome. The Singaporean lady that we sat next to during this display said that because they don't have any natural beauty to enjoy, they've just created their own, different type of beauty.

## iLight and the bay

Whilst we were there Singapore had a festival of light in the marina called iLight. The installations, which were designed by a number of artists, all featured light and focused on sustainable electricity production. One cool display involved light being shone across the water between buoys in different patterns representing various constellations.

## Botanical Gardens

North west of central Singapore are huge, free botanical gardens that we spent the best part of a day in. Not much description is required, so here are some pictures we took:

## Singapore National Museum

Another museum that we visited whilst in Singapore was the National Museum, which contains a history of the country. I didn't know much about the split from Malaysia or Singaporean history more generally so found it to be a pretty interesting exhibition, if a little self congratulatory.

As if you wouldn't hang around with these guys.

For me the most interesting part was the description of how they have dealt with the challenges of being so small. They don't have much of their own food or water supply, or much land to spare that's not city. They had some pretty progressive social housing and family planning programmes, to both ensure that everyone had somewhere to live and that the population was kept under control, and their on-going "urban greening" to make up for lack of natural space. It also went into detail about the various incentives that they set up to encourage as many foreign companies to do business there, which were essentially modern incarnations of the trade incentives the British Empire used to make it a profitable colony.

A break from my gushing for a moment. Reading the information at the National Museum it was easy to get swept up by "yay Singapore" tone of it all. It's not necessarily just talk either: The average wage in Singapore is around £34400 compared to the UK's £26500, so it's safe to say it's a pretty wealthy country. However, if you look hard enough (and if you stay where we did, in Little India) you do see signs of the few less fortunate, and of people who are on low incomes. My anecdotal experience is that these individuals tend not to be Straits Chinese... I don't have the information to know if this was just my experience or if there is indeed an income divide than aligns fairly closely to ethnic differences.

They had some insanely huge malls
