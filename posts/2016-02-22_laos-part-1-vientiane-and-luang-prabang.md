# Laos part 1: Vientiane and Luang Prabang

Hello! Sorry for the lack of posting. The internet in Laos was pants across the board, so we were never really able to upload any photos. We’re in Kuala Lumpur now with insane internet speeds.

Here is a rather long overview of the first half of our time in Laos!

## Vientiane

We crossed the border into Laos from Nong Khai. It was a relatively stress free experience - getting our Laos visa in Khon Kaen meant that we could just hop on an international bus in Thailand straight to Vientiane, with just a short hop off at the border to be stamped in and out.

Many people talk about Laos as being “relatively untouched” and only “recently open for tourism”. This is slightly ridiculous for a number of reasons:

Laos was opened up for tourism in 1989. The year I was born. To some people that may feel recent, but to me it’s essentially the beginning of time.
Laos has been colonised by the French, bombed to smithereens by the Americans, had  sizeable aid given by the Japanese and the Australians, and is now seeing a lot of foreign investment from China. The standard of English, even in the middle of a mountain town, is incredible (as is the standard of French, Japanese, Korean and Chinese). You can buy cheap, delicious imported wine. They make bloody good croissants. Burgers are delicious. I’ve not seen a McDonalds or a Starbucks but I have seen Dao coffee and Fuji restaurants (both asian chains). None of this screams “untouched”, and the more I think about it I don’t really know what that means anyway.
The internet exists.

Anyway, Vientiane. I. Love. Vientiane. The various travel websites I looked at whilst planning our trip here were pretty down on Vientiane but I’m not really sure why. It’s full of interesting architecture, good food, and delicious coffee. It’s small, so you can feel like you know it a relatively small amount of time, and it’s chill af.

The morning market on Vientiane

I was particularly enamoured with the architecture of Vientiane, which reflects the changing political landscape of the country. You will find ancient Stupas next to slightly deteriorating french colonial buildings, next to soviet-esque government buildings, next to wooden houses with corrugated iron rooves. Temples sometimes have Chinese, Burmese, Thai and Japanese influences, in a single complex.

Me for scale. This was opposite the crumbing colonial building above.

Having said all that, I’m still surprised we both took to it as much as we did, because the first few days we were there it was cold and rainy. And man alive are we not kitted out to deal with cold and rainy. It was as low as 5 degrees, which may not seem that low if you’re in the UK, but all of our clothes are aimed at 30 degrees and up. Plus, the room that we were staying in was definitely designed to cool you down - there was a 2 inch gap between the top of the door and the door frame, tiled floors, thin blankets, and no heating. Those first few days we did very little, essentially running to a coffee shop in the morning and staying there all day.

Most coffee served in Laos is grown on the Bolaven Plateau. The growing of coffee in this region was introduced by the French when figuring out how to make Laos a profitable colony. It’s rich, and chocolaty, and can easily be bought without sugar/sweetened condensed milk (I’m looking at you, Thailand).

Also, I drank wine after a 2 month Thailand enforced hiatus. It was better than any wine I’ve ever had in my life.

When the weather cleared, we visited one of the bigger temples in the city: Wat Sisaket. I was surprised by how different it looked to the temples that we’d visited in Thailand. As I mentioned above, the temples here (or the ones I’ve seen at least) appear to have been influenced by several schools of temple architecture. I hope that makes it sound like I know anything about “schools of temple architecture”. Lol, as if. Essentially, Sisaket looked surprisingly Japanese in areas, with gorgeous, simple wooden structures, more ornately Chinese in others, and the stupas had either a Thai or Burmese look to them.
Here’s some pictures:

In the centre of one of the main roads in Vientiane is an Arc De Triomphe knock off that was never quite finished. Although it looks grand and impressive from afar:

As you approach, the lack of finish becomes apparent:

It’s not clear what the point of it is. Maybe the French were homesick?

The most interesting part of our stay in Vientiane (apart from the wine that is), was our visit to the UXO centre which we visited on a friend’s recommendation. The centre is part of a medical charity that provides prosthetic limbs to people within Laos. Whilst there was information in the centre about all facets of this work, the bulk of the exhibition focused on the impact of Unexploded Ordnances within Laos.

I’m not going to launch into too much of a lecture about this, but here’s an overview (to read more, google ‘The Secret War Laos’).

Between 1964 and 1973 over 580,000 bombing missions were carried out in Laos by the CIA, which resulted in Laos getting the dubious accolade of most bombed country in the world, per capita. The bombing missions were part of the American intervention in the Laotian civil war, in which they supported the Royal Lao Government against the communist Pathet Lao. Here are some facts about the bombings from the charity Legacies of War:

Over 270 million cluster bombs were dropped on Laos during the Vietnam War (210 million more bombs than were dropped on Iraq in 1991, 1998 and 2006 combined); up to 80 million did not detonate.
More than half of all confirmed cluster munitions casualties in the world have occurred in Laos.
Each year there continue to be over 100 new casualties in Laos. Close to 60% of the accidents result in death, and 40% of the victims are children.
Between 1995 and 2013, the U.S. contributed on average $3.2M per year for UXO clearance in Laos; the U.S. spent $13.3M per day (in 2013 dollars) for nine years bombing Laos.
The U.S. spent as much in three days bombing Laos ($51M, in 2010 dollars) than it spent for clean up over 16 years ($51M).

Much of this wasn’t in the exhibition, which instead focused on the long term impact of the unexploded bombs. In particular, it explained the charity's attempts to prevent locals from getting involved in the dangerous scrap trade that’s grown around the materials left by bombs. The exhibition featured a small house filled with various items that are often made with UXO materials, including rice cookers, fishing hooks, fans and other everyday objects. Despite the education that organisations like the ones who run the centre provide about this dangerous trade, it  is a source of income that is still tempting enough to many of the impoverished inhabitants of rural Laos. Hence the prosthetic limbs.

It was an incredibly well curated exhibition, but was pretty difficult to deal with by the end.

## Luang Prabang

Monks on the Mekong

After a week in Vientiane we headed north to Luang Prabang, a UNESCO world heritage town, and the most popular tourist destination in Laos. Laos currently has only one train station (just over the border from Thailand, near Nong Khai) and so you can head to north from the capital either by boat, along the Mekong, or by bus. We chose the 12 hour bus ride. The roads of Laos can be somewhat bumpy, so it wasn’t a particularly comfy journey. This was made up in spades, though, by the view that we had from our precarious mountainside road.

As we drove I decided that 1. Laos was the most beautiful place I’ve ever been, and 2. I really, really wanted to be in those mountains. We decided to slog four hours further north than Luang Prabang a week later because of number 2.

There’s not tonnes and tonnes to do in Luang Prabang, it’s a pretty tiny town after all. And also a pretty, tiny town. We spent quite a lot of time gawking at the Mekong, especially as the sun was setting. Sometimes whilst drinking really cheap gin. And sometimes whilst drinking really not cheap brandy.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0x9koc3qnl5le7t/IMG_0027%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0)

In the centre of town there’s a large hill, at the top of which is a Stupa and a viewing platform from which you can see the whole town and the surrounding mountains. I’d read that the best time to go was at sunset, so we hefted our way up the many stairs one evening at the beginning of our stay. Whilst the photos online suggest that you view this delightful scene on your very lonesome this was not really the case. Exhibit A:

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tsry7aq7c433eeo/IMG_9943%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0)

“Well you were the one that wanted to come up here in the first place” was being thrown around a fair bit, and as soon as the sun dipped behind the mountains most people left. It was a pretty fun experience if you could be zen about it, mostly because there were so many people who really couldn’t.

Also because it looked like this:

Another of the “must see” things was the night market, which I was not a fan of, mostly because I kept accidentally walking into it and then getting stuck behind the slowest people in the world.

I’ve always been a bit queazy about the “hill tribe” tours that are sold in both Thailand and Laos. I’m sure there are ones which are both informative and sensitive to the places that you visit, but to me it feels too much like you’d be going to a human zoo. However, I also am genuinely interested in knowing about them, so I was excited to visit the Ethnology Centre In Luang Prabang. This research centre carries out projects with members of ethnic minorities, and has a small exhibition about the minorities they work with.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0w2fni03hzsv4f9/IMG_0147%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0)

It was easily the best thing we visited whilst in town. There was lots of information about the 4 main ethnic groups, focusing on the various products that they specialise in producing (woven textiles, embroidery, basketry, paper goods). What I enjoyed most about the information, though, was the way it dealt with the changes to the traditional way of life these minorities have seen as Laos has developed. Instead of looking nostalgically at how their traditions used to be carried out, it celebrated the modern medicine, production techniques and technologies that they now have, demonstrating how they have evolved various parts of their lives to incorporate these without necessary losing what makes them them. That’s not to say it was all peachy about changes to their life, it just gave a more balanced assessment than I was expecting.

As well as being a museum and research centre, the Ethnology Centre also runs programmes with women from various minorities to help them utilise their crafts to build a business. I discovered that many of the stalls at the night market were ran by women who had worked with the centre, which made me reevaluate my lack of patience with it… slightly.

The other main attraction that we visited was the National Museum, which is located in what used to be the royal palace, before all the communism, and focuses on the monarchy. You’re not allowed to take photos inside, which is a bit of a bummer, especially because the main hall has the most insanely decorated walls. My favourite part of the museum was the room which displays the various gifts the monarchy received from other countries. Ornate tea sets from China and Japan, a piece of moon from America, and a boomerang from Australia. Not even a special boomerang - it had a sticker on it to say it came from “one of” the indigenous tribes. Get a grip Australia. At least pretend to be specific.

The palace.

Part of the museum complex grounds. The thing in the top left, on the balcony, is a chicken costume. Because reasons.

These many headed Naga were on the national museum grounds - we saw many examples of these on temples throughout Laos.

In all, whilst I liked Luang Prabang, I was ready to leave when we did. To be honest, I got pretty bored by the end. Everything was a little too preened, too aimed at tourists and travellers. I’m finding it hard to express what exactly it was that I didn’t like that much - I think in the end Vientiane felt like a living city, where people live and worked, and Luang Prabang felt like a painting of a city.

We could hear banging one morning and came out of the hotel to see these monks sledgehammering the wall of their temple.
