# China part 2

After a very relaxing time in Dali we travelled further north to the next destination in the Yunnan Old Town Hit List:

## Lijiang

Lijiang is significantly larger and more well known than Dali, and still a little nervous from our Kunming Old Town experience we were a worried about what we were going to find. Once again, though, our worries were unfounded as Lijiang turned out to be even more lovely than Dali.

I mentioned in my last post that "Old Town" is a bit of a misnomer for these places, as most of the buildings are pretty new so they should really be called Old Style Towns. When I was researching both Lijiang and Dali I came across a number of blog posts and articles dismissing/ridiculing the towns because of this, and generally complaining about China's propensity to bulldoze all the things.

For me this comes back to how difficult it is to not judge other cultures by standards that seem obvious and objectively right to us, but of course are not.

Sure, I'm glad that in the UK we make an effort to preserve historical buildings, meaning that towns throughout the country contain a hodgepodge of architecture that reveal to a discerning viewer its particular history. To assume that this is the objectively correct thing to do though, is a tad silly. We preserve buildings and other artifacts because of our particular relationship with history. I don't think it's a stretch to say that as a culture we have a tendency to idealise our past, often at the expense of critically examining the less savoury parts. Whilst I don't think its the only reason we preserve old architecture, their link to a time when the UK was a leading strength in the world obviously plays a part.

All that to say: I liked Lijiang. It was an interesting place to see a little bit of China's history, and a lot of how modern day China thinks about its past.

I can't say we did much whilst in Lijiang except wander around and eat. It's a pretty labyrinthine place so it was fun to lose ourselves in the alleyways. It was particularly lovely in the early morning and late evening when most of the visitors had left and you caught a glimpse of the inhabitants going about their daily life: the streams that had been picturesque backdrops to 1001 selfies became communal washing basins for clothes, and the streets that crammed with tourists at noon, began the day as a complicated delivery network for men on bikes carrying huge sacks of chillies, dried beans and Sichuan peppercorns.

When we tired of wandering the streets picking up sticks of meat or fried pastries, we ventured marginally further afield to the nearby Black Dragon Pool. As with Dali, the crowds tended to confine themselves to a central core of streets, and so it was easy to break free when we wanted to.

Oh look, another selfie where you can't really tell where we are.

## Chengdu

When we were in Laos I read a book by of one of my favourite food/recipe writers: Fuchsia Dunlop. Originally from Oxford, she studied cooking at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine, and has written a number of English language, Chinese cookbooks. If I've ever cooked Chinese food for you, it would have been using one of her recipes.

Anyway, whilst her memoire covers various locations in China, it is essentially a love letter to the food of Chengdu. After reading it I couldn't not visit.

Unfortunately, China is big. As I have mentioned. And whilst the distance between Lijiang and Chengdu doesn't look like much on a map, it's over a day's travel by two modes of transport. We got on a bus for 7 hours, waited at a train station for 3 hours, got on a train for 15 hours, arrived completely shattered.

### Tea in the park(s)

In the first post about China I mentioned that parks seemed to be the centre of social activity, and nowhere is that more true than Chengdu. There were some amazing parks in this city, but our favourite was the People's Park. We spent several hours whiling away the time at the huge tea shop in the centre of the park, watching the world go by.

For next to nothing you could order a sachet of leaf tea, which came with a ginormous thermos of boiling water from which to top up your tea. Whilst drinking tea we would get propositioned by one of the wandering men clanging what looked like tuning forks, and whose only English was the word "comfortable". It turned out that they were ear cleaners, and would stand scooping, brushing and generally prodding at the ears of whoever hired their services. Every person I saw having their ears cleaned looked incredibly relaxed throughout the process, but it never really appealed to me. Aside from the fact that it involved a rando shoving sticks in your ear, I never once saw one of the men cleaning their instruments... Still, it was fun to watch.

Another of our favourite parks, Wangjiang park, was dedicated to Xue Tao whose statue watched passers by from the bamboo.

### Pandas

Along with drinking tea in the park and eating all the chillies your stomach can handle, another Chengdu "must" is visiting the panda sanctuary, because pandas!

There's not much to say about the sanctuary really: it was pretty fun to watch the bears eat vast quantities of food and generally slob out but there wasn't that much information about them or the various conservation activities that the centre presumably spearheads.

Red pandas!

### All the spice in the world

Whilst wandering the streets of Chengdu, we quickly found that it was difficult to resist eating for very long. Whereas Beijing, Shanghai and many of the large eastern cities have air pollution that you could cut with a knife, the air of Chengdu begs to be slurped up with a spoon. The smell of soup hangs over everything, and it is completely irresistible.

In Sichuanese food chillies are there not just for heat, but to provide a whole range of flavour. You can get dishes that have a deep, dry warmth but whose heat lasts only as long as the meal, soups whose fragrant chillies have a light flavour that builds and builds until your face is on fire. Then, there's the Sichuan peppercorns. They come in either red or green and neither smell nor taste anything like the pepper we have at home. They add a numbing or tingling sensation to any dish they're added to, and if you eat one whole you die.

So, we ate and ate and ate. Hot pot was my favourite. You and your dining companions sit around a huge pot of bubbling, chilli filled soup/lava and over the course of an hour or two you use the soup to cook meat, vegetables, tofu, and whatever else you order. The soup flavours the meat and veg, and vice versa. I ate it all the time when in China previously, but those eastern versions paled in comparison to the ones we ate in Chengdu.

There was a small dumpling place just around the corner from our hostel that we ate a few times. They were the bomb.

Whenever we saw a statue or photograph of Mao (which was all the time), I couldn't help wondering what it must be like for the people who managed to live through the Cultural Revolution to see his face everywhere.

## Shanghai

After Chengdu we had another epic journey across the width of the country to Shanghai on the east coast. We took what ended up being a pretty comfortable train, so it went quicker than I thought it would but was still pretty draining.

Shanghai is the only place in China that we'd been to before, and it was nice to revisit some of the places Jack and I had seen 9 years before. We didn't do much sight seeing, but spent a couple of days wandering along the Bund and around the old French Concession, and of course, in parks.

By the time we reached Shanghai we'd pretty much reached peak exhaustion from moving so often/just being in China and so it felt much more like a place to pause and wait for the next country rather than a destination in and of itself.

Our time in China was strange, and hard, and fantastic, and exhausting. As I said in my last post, it's the place that we had our highest highs and our lowest lows. We frequently got frustrated with being surrounded by people whose behaviours and social conventions felt at odds with our own, but this also made all the positive encounters that we had all the more rewarding and exciting. I'm already thinking of all the other places in China I'd like to explore, and the things I'd like to see. Perhaps in smaller doses, though, in the future...
