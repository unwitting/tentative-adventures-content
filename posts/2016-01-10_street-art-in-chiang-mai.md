# Street art in Chiang Mai

During the two weeks we spent in Chiang Mai wandering between coffee shops, we noticed a number of striking pieces of street art, both within the old city and out west towards the university. Chiang Mai is known for it's artsy community, so this isn't too surprising, but it made us retrospectively notice the lack of street art in other parts of Thailand that we've travelled to.

I've done a little research into the graffiti of Chiang Mai - cue wild assumptions which may or may not be true:

## A potentially incorrect review of some themes

After some skimming of the interwebs, it seems that some see the (relative) proliferation of street art in Chiang Mai as representative of the ever increasing influence of the West in Thai society, as there is no particular history in Thailand of this art form.

However, we've noticed a number of pieces around the city which themselves seem to contest Western influence in other areas of Thai society. In particular, there are a number of stickers which say something like "our boys cannot be Baht", or "we are not baht" which I'm assuming refers to the sextourists/sexpats who litter the streets here. (I forgot to take a picture of these signs... oops).

Also, an interview I read with one of the more famous street artists, Alex Face, who has a number of bits and pieces across this city states that many of his images protest increasing levels of consumerism. Not that consumerism is specific to the West, but still, it usually features heavily in worries about increasing influence of western countries.

Another theme which I've read about, but haven't seen many examples of, is a critique of the King and/or government. As you may know, Thailand is currently... in-between democratically elected governments. Outward criticism of the King or of the military rule is forbidden, so it makes sense that an anonymous art form (or at least, one usually not linked to the real names of artists) like graffiti would be a site for worries about this.

Understandably, this wasn't a particularly "in your face" theme, and I'm still unsure that I saw any real examples of it. One large wall included a television set with eyes, which could be a riff on the whole 1984, they're always watching, Big Brother field of government critique.

There were also a few pieces which included Anonymous mask style faces which could have been part of this, as they're often worn by individuals during government protests across the globe. I have a whole spiel I could go into here that anyone who spent enough time with me during my Masters would have heard and be bored of. I'll save you from it, but suffice to say I found the slightly asian-ised Guy Fawkes mask piece (pic below) very interesting.

The main problem here is that I still know very little about Thai culture, and especially Thai politics. Recognising what are likely to be fairly subtle critiques is probably beyond my understanding at this stage.

The main theme that I noticed, though, was that graffiti was being used as a method of advertising. We spotted several images that were similar to each other dotted around (like the foxes and birds), which then turned out to be linked to a cafe. There was a whole wall in one carpark that was dedicated to a bar, and there were graffiti-esque stickers dotted around that were linked to another drinking spot.

Enough of this rambling. Have some photos:

This piece is by Alex Face, the artist mentioned above. He has been commissioned to paint murals in a number of places across the city - this one is on the side of Freebird Cafe, a social enterprise just outside of the Old City.

Fairly randomly, I came across an interview with him in a cafe, where he talks about the various symbology in images like this one:

"That third eye represents the things that you can't see with two eyes, which you can see if you meditate long enough [...] The face in all of my artwork is my daughter as a baby [...] I paint her looking upset because I think we all need to worry about the future. There are more people in the world, and those people need food, but all the land is being paved over. Land is now being used for malls filled with things we don't need. It is a waste."
