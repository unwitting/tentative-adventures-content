# A few days in the Lake District

It's important to warm up for big events, so as practise for the big one-way travelling adventure to Asia, we went for a training holiday in the Lake District. Hard job, but someone's got to do it.

We stayed in a cottage in the hamlet of Millbeck, just north of Keswick, a town pretty much on Derwentwater. Millbeck's in a great location on the slopes leading up toward Skiddaw, the sixth highest summit of the Lakes; on the evening we arrived we only had to walk a few minutes along a path near the cottage to end up on the foothills and take some pictures of our first sunset there. Sunsets in the Lakes tend to light up the hills with a spectacular red colour from the various rusty brown flora. For a first-timer like me, it was a breathtaking start.

We drove over to the nearby town of Cockermouth for dinner and a few local pints in a pub called The Bitter End. Fantastic steak and ale pies all round and the house ale alongside a load of bottled craft beers made for a pretty perfect end to a long day of driving.

The next day we were going for one of the big ones; Helvellyn. This is the third highest summit in the Lakes (and in fact England) and it is quite simply gorgeous. The more I read about it, the more I realise how incredibly lucky we were to get a clear sunny day on this mountain in November.

We met our extra climbing companion for the day in the village of Glenridding which sits between Helvellyn and its lake, Ullswater. From there you can get straight onto the climb (which is what makes Glenridding so popular with climbers and walkers) and before long be a good way up above the lake.

A constant and steep but view-heavy climb then follows until, if you're climbing from the East as we were, you hit Red Tarn and a choice of two ridges leading to the summit.

Wrapping around the tarn's left as you approach is Striding Edge, a sharp-topped rock ridge that's a little nerve-wracking even on a sunny, dry day. I can't imagine what it's like in the snow and strong wind. Around 1.5km long, it drops steeply on both sides and provides you with a sharp rock top to scramble over and sometimes climb in earnest.

This was our route; after a long scramble that was just the right amount of heart-racing, we reached the summit plateau and made our merry way to the shelters to sit, enjoy some lunch and a little cup of port each. It's the little things.

Returning to Glenridding we took the other of the two ridges, known as Swirral Edge. This is a shorter but just as characterful scramble over scree and larger boulders. A coffee in Glenridding followed by a great big curry in Keswick rounded off a tiring but rewarding day's climbing and put us all to bed shamefully early.

The following day we planned more fun around Ullswater and Glenridding. First up was Aira Force, a beautiful 20-odd meter waterfall of Aira Beck not long before it joins the lake. The valley it runs through is the stuff of fairy stories; vivid green moss, babbling streams and vast old trees.

Back in Glenridding we arranged to take a tour of Ullswater on the Ullswater 'Steamer'. The inverted commas are theirs, not mine; presumably since they're not actually steamers anymore. They run hop-on, hop-off circuits of the lake throughout the year. While we waited for the departure we dropped in to the Inn on the Lake for some views onto the crystal clear and perfectly still water and a hefty lunch in their gardens.

By the time the boat arrived, we were a little cold. Ten minutes into the tour, the weather did that Lake District thing it does and hit us with sudden impenetrable fog and even colder air, leading to a lot of sheltering below deck with coffees and the occasional peek up top for some mysterious misty views. We got our second great sunset here though.

Back at the cottage we rustled up a big ol' November Christmas dinner; we won't be around for Christmas Day with family this year so we had a little Christmas of our own, roaring log fire and all.

On our final day we wanted to take in a different area so drove over to the Wasdale valley, home of Wastwater (which, for anyone interested, is a glacially over-deepened lake, with the surface being around 200ft above sea level and the bottom being 50ft below it).

We visited on a stunning day; not sunny but a kind of bleak grey that really brought out the loneliness of this valley. A single road running along the one buildable side of the lake (the other is a steep scree slope that you can't even pass on foot) eventually gets you to Wasdale Head, a hamlet even smaller than Millbeck. It claims to be home to the England's highest mountain, deepest lake, smallest church and biggest liar. Opinion's divided on the last one, but one thing I know is that pretty much the biggest building there is the Wasdale Head Inn; proudly standing not far from the lake with the word INN written on it in letters so big you could read them from Scafell Pike (which I understand is rather the point).

The inn calls itself the home of British rock climbing; one Samuel Coleridge supposedly used it as a base to scramble Scafell Pike all the way back in 1802. Whatever it is, nowadays it's a good centre for walkers and climbers to stop off at on the way up or down the nearby fells and seems to get a constant just-pleasant amount of custom all day every day. In keeping with many other Lake District pubs, it also had a pretty vast selection of Scotch, so I treated myself to a large dram of a smooth and sweet 14-year-old Oban single malt. I was in the middle of a bad toothache at the time so it was at least a bit medicinal.

And then we were away. One death-defying and slightly tense drive over the absolutely mad Hardknott Pass in dense fog (a few cars and sheep encountered at uncomfortable ranges) later and we were looking at leaving the Lakes behind. A fantastic couple of days in a place that reminds you how beautiful England can be.
