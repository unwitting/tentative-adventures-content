# North Vietnam

My Dad visited us!! It was weird and awesome to do some traveling with him. Weird because Jack and I have spent so much time alone that we've become freaks who don't know how to behave in the company of others, and awesome because, well my Dad was with us!

We had just under 2 weeks to spend in Vietnam, so we decided to spend it all in Hanoi and Halong Bay.

Jack and I arrived half a day before my Dad, and decided it would make sense to head into town, drop off our stuff and get our bearings a little before heading back to the airport to pick up Dad.

The local bus that we took to the city centre prepared us a little for what we were about to find as we journeyed through rural landscapes, and then increasingly busy roads.

Hanoi is insane. It's crowded and manic. And awesome. At any one time you're likely to have approximately 90 motorbikes heading straight for you, regardless of whether you're crossing the road or on the path.

Photos don't capture this very well, so here's someone else's video:



We ended up watching a video on the best approach to crossing the roads (because we're lame like that). The key is to just walk into the road slowly, without stopping. This fully worked and was a bit of a revelation to be honest. It makes you feel like Moses. Probably not a technique to try at home though.

## Wandering the city

The 'old town' part of the city is warren like, and we never really got our head around its layout in the same way we have in other places. I say 'we', I obviously never have a clue where I am or where I'm going, but even Jack struggled in Hanoi.

One pretty interesting characteristic of Hanoi old town was that each road seems to be dedicated to a particular trade. The road our hotel was on, for example, was full of metal workshops producing some pretty strong looking stainless steel cabinets etc. We saw other roads populated entirely by haberdasheries, motorcycle repair shops, picture framing shops, and electrical components to name a few.

The aforementioned road mayhem meant that wandering aimlessly was a pretty intense experience, so we often broke it up at the many coffee shops that line the streets. It was fun to spend time watching the world go by without having to be in the fray yourself. It was also a good way to spot the different precarious loads being carried on motorbikes: I think the most mad example was the guy who appeared to be carrying a gas tank the size of which I've only ever seen supplying rural homes with gas. It was impressive. We didn't get any good photos of this sort of thing, but my Dad got some cracking ones.

On our wanderings around town we were often drawn to the two lakes in central Hanoi. Both provided another way to gain respite from the busy roads of old town, both to us and Hanoi locals. In particular, the edges of these lakes hosted numerous groups of old men, playing cards, Mahjong or generally making fun of each other.

## War museum

Whilst I have a general understanding of the Vietnam War, I don't really know that much about it so I was looking forward to the Hanoi War Museum. I'm not entirely sure I came away with a better picture of the war but I've certainly seen a lot of weapons used to "annihilate the enemy".

This museum had 0 chill. It had cases and cases of guns, crazy spiked balls, and bamboo sticks all accompanied with how many people they were used to kill. Alongside these there were very emotive descriptions of why the French Colonial rule sucked. Also, they had the uniform John McCain was wearing when he was captured, after crashing into one of the lakes mentioned above.

This was all interesting I guess, but not really that informative. The best parts were where it talked about the actual tactical organisation of the guerrilla warfare, which mostly centred on mobilising people living in the various hamlets spread across the jungle. Even accounting for the blatant propaganda, reading about the communist's

Funny that they didn't really mention the huge weapons they received from the USSR though...

Around the main buildings of the museum was a huge collection of tanks, planes and various heavy machinery that were taken from the Americans. I was pretty into this sculpture made from a Hellcat:

An interesting take away for me was that most of the descriptions throughout the museum contained a lot of anger towards the French, but almost none towards the Americans. Perhaps they felt the lists of American soldiers killed by Vietnamese hands was enough.

## Hanoi Hilton

The Hanoi Hilton is the nickname given to Hỏa Lò Prison situated in the centre of Hanoi that was used to house prisoners of war during the Vietnamese war. Before that, it was used by the French as a prison for revolutionaries. The conditions described in increasingly emotive language by the exhibition sounded pretty horrendous. It also described the means by which prisoners attempted escape, and how they spread the instructions and manifestos from the outside. Towards the end of this section of the museum, it lists the many current officials who spent time in the prison.

If you believe the exhibition, "Hanoi Hilton" wasn't an ironic name at all as the soldiers kept there were having the time of their lives. Pictures showed them playing sports, laughing over a chess game, receiving high quality medical care. Interestingly it showed the same 6 soldiers doing all of these things...

In summary, the museums of Hanoi provided an excellent lesson in propaganda.

## Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4mhs7effopxkgj5/IMG_1704.jpg?dl=0)

Ho Chi Minh was the leader of the Viet Minh independence movement, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and led the People's Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong against the French and American forces in the Vietnamese War.

He's a pretty interesting guy: he lived in the US, France, China and the UK before returning to Vietnam to, you know, communist it up. He was a very accomplished linguist, as well as a poet, journalist and, bizarrely, pastry chef. He abdicated his position at the head of the Party and president of North Vietnam in 1965 because of poor health and died in 1969 before the Vietnamese War ended.

In fact, it may not come as a surprise to find out that Ho Chi Minh is central to the Communist Party's propaganda effort. They have essentially created a personality cult around him, to the extent that some members of the public are said to worship him... His face is everywhere, and his life is very present in the vietnamese education system. Also, they call him Uncle Ho.

The mausoleum is modelled after Lenin's and, like Lenin, his embalmed body is on display for daily queues of people to reverently walk past. Mao and Kim Jong-Il's mausoleums have a similar corpse display and crowd appeal. Because communism I guess.

We didn't go into the Mausoleum itself but we did wander around the grounds people watching for a good while.

## Temple of Literature

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/uzcvxzxe0n7cbvc/IMG_1786.jpg?dl=0)

In my head this was going to be essentially a huge library, around which were shrines to various writers, perhaps even specific books and poems. Alas, this wasn't the case.

The Temple of Literature was Vietnam's first University, built in 1070. It comprises a series of very beautiful courtyards, huge stones engraved with the names of those who passed the royal exams after studying at the university and an altar to Confucius.

Halong Bay

## Getting there

There are 1001 tour operators in Hanoi that can take you to Halong Bay but many of them are quite expensive and seem to spend a lot of time doing things that the three of us weren't especially interested in. So, we decided to catch a bus with one of these groups and then manage our own trip walking and hiking on the island of Cat Ba without having to endure awkward karaoke on a cruise boat.

The bus ride was fine and not too long, so we arrived at Halong without much of a hiccup. However, we were dropped at a swish looking port, and taken to a man who was handily waiting for people without pre-booked onward travel. After telling us that the last public ferry was long gone he quoted us £60 to get across to the island.

Luckily our bullshit radar is well honed, so we gave him a "nah mate" and went on our merry way. 20 mins later we found the public ferry, for which we paid almost nothing, and which gave us some pretty epic views of the bay as we crossed to our destination.

## Wandering around Cat Ba

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/b9ni9co2slmj60l/IMG_1999.jpg?dl=0)

The main shopping front of Cat Ba was a little grim, but the water and the island itself was pretty lovely. We spent a day wandering around the fringes of the town ending up at a couple of quiet beaches.

On the way around we also saw one of the fishing villages that many tour groups end up visiting. Many of the boats that make up the village are lashed together, often around big flat platforms. The whole scene fitted perfectly with my mental image of the Gyptians from His Dark Materials, so I was pretty on board with them (oh ho ho).

My dad hired a kayak one day and paddled around the island, past this village who were apparently incredibly friendly.

## Walk in the National Park

A huge swathe of Cat Ba is covered by National Park. At the time we visited a number of the walking routes weren't open, but we were still able to head on up to the peak, where we were treated to this fabulous view:

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xuxj1zjj6zz5pnc/IMG_2194.jpg?dl=0)

Yeah, it was pretty foggy the whole time we were in Vietnam, and the peak was a just the right height to plunge you head first into it. Never mind, the climb is it's own reward!

Part of the climb was fairly steep and slippy so took some concentration, but we were often treated to fantastic views and grotto-like pathways.

Along the bottom of the mountain was an odd collection of dilapidated houses, often with no roofs. Nobody seemed to live in them, but they were fronted by fairly immaculate vegetable gardens. Not sure what was going on there.

## Vietnam Hoi!

Whilst we were on Cat Ba they were having some sort of festival. It was very confusing. We eventually figured out that it was a week long launch of the tourist season. Except, it wasn't. It was a one day festival that they spent the whole week practicing, in front of all the people who would be at the actual festival.

It was mostly traditional Vietnamese songs, dancing, shouting "Vietnam Hoi/Oi", really boring financial reports and a single One Direction song.

Unfortunately I ended Vietnam on a downer, as I got pretty ill just after Dad left for Bangkok. Which was annoying as it ruined my streak of good health, and therefore my high-horse vis a vie Jack's flu/other minor illnesses.
