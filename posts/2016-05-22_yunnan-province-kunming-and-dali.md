# Yunnan Province: Kunming and Dali

It's been almost 9 years, but we're back! Or we were back, now we've left again. Anyway: China!

Incase you aren't aware, China is big. Like, really, really big. To give you a sense of scale Yunnan, the first province we visited, is 394,000 km2 - the UK is 242,495 km2. There are 22 provinces in China.

We forgot this when planning our route. Even after pairing back our list of destinations, we ended up with a few pretty long train journeys. In fact, even when we were in the cities that we'd just taken 15 hours to get to we still kept forgetting the scale of the place, plan to walk to a "near-by" tourist attraction, and then realise it was a 2 day journey by foot.

In the end, we decided on a few stops in Yunnan, a province in the south west, home to a large proportion of China's ethnic minorities and some pretty amazing scenery, followed by a stop in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, home to a large proportion of China's chillies, and then a final stop in Shanghai, the other side of the country.

Yuan in Yunnan

## Kunming 昆明

Kunming is the capital of Yunnan province, and we had 2 full days to explore before moving on. It was a pretty chilled city (with one notable exception, explained below).

### Green lake park

On our first full day in Kunming we headed over to Green Lake Park, as it was listed as one of the few sights in the city. Parks are a pretty big deal in China, every one we've been to has been full and bustling with people meeting friends, drinking tea, playing cards and mahjong, practising tai chi, group singing, group dancing, playing instruments, feeding the koi. They're not particularly quiet places to be... but they're definitely fun.

Green lake park was pretty lovely, centred on - you guessed it - a big green lake. It was tipping it down most of the time we were there, but we still had enjoyed wandering around taking everything in.

This guy was playing a Chinese lyre and it was just fantastic. If you try and bring to mind some Chinese sounding music, the string instrument you're imagining is probs the lyre. This guy, though, was interweaving some crazy plucking with more traditional sounding stuff, it was really cool. It got us well into the China mood

### Old town

Throughout Yunnan (and perhaps China - I'm not sure), there are a number of historic old towns that are pretty big tourist draws. They're usually not quite what you expect, as the actual buildings are rarely old, but rather newly constructed in an old style. I've heard them referred to as new-old towns because of this.

I didn't realise that Kunming had an old town until we were there and looking for things to do. We decided to head over on our second full day in the city. The old town is sectioned off from the rest of the city by a wall on one side, and as we approached Jack and I noticed a distinct increase in noise. When we open the gate we were assaulted with clouds of ash (from the billions of people smoking), 4 different pieces of music coming from 4 differently located, but equally poor quality speakers, and a crowd of people the size of the entire population of Wales.

It was our first taste of Chinese tourism, and thankfully the worst example of it. One thing we quickly realised on this trip was that whilst most of the places we visited were very set up for tourists, we were not not the market they were aiming at. The overwhelming majority of tourists in China are Chinese. And there are loads of them. Enough to fill 1000s of tourist busses a day.

To be honest, for me the least enjoyable parts of this trip were the interactions we had with Chinese tourists (especially compared to those with the locals of each town we were in). They often gawked at us in a way that was uncomfortable and not always friendly. I think we were usually seen as just another part of the tourist experience. They spat everywhere, littered, climbed on everything and rarely seemed that interested in the attraction they were at.

I get that I'm sounding like a grump. An old, hermit-y grump. And sometimes that's exactly what I was. We definitely had more days in China where we just couldn't face going outside. But, whilst there were lower lows, there were most definitely higher highs. For every person shouting "hey Laowei (foreigner)", staring at us, laughing, there were two smiling, helping us out, making sure we got where we needed to go. China is the place where people seemed the most different to us, and that could be both a source of great pleasure and great pain.

Anyway, I've gone off topic.

Chinese tourists: they just don't visit things the way we do. We left Kunming old town pretty quickly, but not before finding a couple of quieter spots and snapping a few photos.

### Wandering around. Also eating.

After abandoning the old town we wandered around Kunming, heading towards the university. By the way, a tip: if you're in a new place and want to find tasty, cheap food find a school or university. This hasn't failed us yet. In Kunming, we found a Xinjiang style restaurant next to a large high school that served up some delicious food.

As well as exploring the university area, we spent a lot of our time in the main, pedestrianised square in the centre of the city. The draw here was also food. In the centre of the square is a coffee shop surrounded on all sided by street food vendors. You can go along, buying up various sticks of deliciousness and then take them all into the coffee house to eat whilst having a drink. An added bonus for us was the huge windows that we could people watch through.

The food of Yunnan was pretty delicious, and quite unlike any Chinese food I'd had before. It had cheese, for a start. Yaks are a big deal in the province, and so along with using their meat in a variety of ways, the locals make a type of cheese from their milk. This practice comes from the ethnic minorities of the area, which are many (especially compared to the rest of China). There's also a number of dishes that are very similar to Laotian food: sticky pineapple rice and laab (minced meat with herbs and chilli) being two, which makes sense given that a number of the ethnic groups of this area come from very close to the border with Laos. Another Yunnan speciality is cured meat. They make a damn fine bacon, and the tourists from other parts of China were buying it by the tonne. Add in dishes from neighbouring Sichuan, and you've got yourself some pretty tasty food.

Not far from the pedestrianised square was a collection of new/old buildings leading up to the "bird and flower market". It was a fun place to explore, and not just because it gave us a taste of the old town without having to actually be near the old town. There were areas throughout where old men took their birds (actual birds, with wings, not their women...) and just chilled, shooting the shit with each other.

This cured pork was served on a hot tile and was the bomb. It was a part of the first meal we had upon our arrival.

The Xinjiang food - it doesn't look like much, but trust me it was delicious. Xinjiang is a province in the north west of China, which has a pretty tumultuous relationship with the rest of the country, to put it mildly.

## Dali 大理

This the first line of the Dali wikipedia page: "Similar to Carlisle in England, Dali City is not a single city but a county-sized area called a city for administrative purposes." ??? Why Carlisle?

Anyway, Dali is 5 hours north of Kunming by train, and is a popular destination for tourists because of it's old town. After our Kunming experience we were a bit nervous about what we were going to find, but in fact we had an excellent time. It was also in Dali that we got an indication of what we were going to find on our Tiger Leaping Gorge hike from the mountains we could see on the horizon.

We arrived in Dali in the evening and were pretty tired so just wanted to find our hotel and sleep. After realising it was too far from the station to walk (see above re: scale), we hailed a taxi and showed him the hotel address in Chinese. Unfortunately, neither he, his other taxi driver mate, nor the taxi head offices had any idea where it was. The second taxi driver, who it turned out was swapping cars with our first driver and was going to be taking us, found the hotel's number, called them, and we set off on our way.

45 minutes later we stopped outside of the biggest, most expensive looking hotel ever, that was definitely not the one we'd booked. We paid, got out, and began walking. Our google map was pointing us to a location not too far from where we were, so we headed that way. Unfortunately, when we arrived at that spot, not a hotel was to be seen. After another hour wandering in circles around the point on the map, my grump levels had intensified to previously unseen heights. It was not pretty. Poor Jack.

We eventually found an unrelated hotel. We walked in and handed our booking document to the girl behind the desk with expressions of desperation. She called over another employee. And then another. They googled for what felt like an age until one seemed to find a relevant phone number. After a very long conversation he began to draw a map, looked up at us, abandoned the map, and beckoned us to follow him.

We were walked a few minutes along the path until we were met by a worried looking woman. It was the owner of our hotel! She took custody of us and we finally made it to the room we had booked.

It was worth the wait, because:

### The old town

Dali old town was actually pretty cool, the buildings were lovely, there was lots of good food, and the constant looming of big, grey clouds made everything a little more atmospheric. We didn't really go in to any of the temples, but just spent most of our time wandering through the streets, drinking Yunnan coffee (another speciality), and eating.

### The three pagodas

One of the sights that we did make time to visit in Dali was the Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple. These pagodas were built in the 9th century, and according to legend serve the function of warding off the dragons that inhabited the area before the arrival of humans. They seemed to work well.

### Erhai lake

Our one year anniversary happened whilst we were in Dali, and we decided to treat ourselves with a 2 night stay at a swish hotel on the shores of Erhai Lake. The lake is a short bus ride away (or a very long walk in the sun which we wont talk about), and is stunning. We did very little whilst we were there: we watched the sun rise over the lake, drank coffee, I had a bath. It was all very relaxing.
