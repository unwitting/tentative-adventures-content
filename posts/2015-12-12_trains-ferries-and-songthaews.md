# Trains, ferries and songthaews

It was our Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.

After a short stay in Prachuap Khiri Khan, we've headed further south to get a taste of island life. Excuse me while I get Insta-famous.

We're on Koh Yao Noi, just of the coast of Krabi on the Andaman coast (the West coast of southern Thailand). We chose it because our Rough Guide said that, whilst the beaches aren't quite as paradise like as some other islands, it has stunning views, still pretty good beaches, and few visitors.

Getting here though, what a ball ache.

## Trains

To manage the single-track system each train has a different priority, and ones lower on the scale have to stay in stations (where the track usually splits) so that high priority trains can whizz by.

We got a special express, which is fairly high priority, so we got to Surat Thani in just a couple of hours. And there was air conditioning. And windows, so I didn't end up orange from dust like I had when we travelled from Bangkok to Prachuap. Such luxuries.

## Taxis

The station at Surat Thani is a couple of miles out of town. When we got off the train, there were several men shouting "Koh Samui" all up in the grills of every farang (foreigner) getting off the train, including mine.

I have just written and then deleted a huge rant about the sheer quantity of scammers in Thailand. Google it. It's fucking annoying.

Aaannnyyyway, after overpaying for a lift, we arrived at our hotel in the heart of what can only be described as the Milton Keynes of Thailand. Or, if you're Jack, the Tatooine of Thailand.

Leg one over.

## Buses

We decided to get the 7:30 bus the next morning, mainly so that we could be out of there before the various "tourist agency" touts got out of bed. Luckily, our hotel was only a block away from the bus station, we found the correct bus without a hitch, and the 3 hour drive to Krabi went very smoothly.

Unluckily, the bus driver wouldn't let us or any of the other farang off at what was clearly the main bus terminal in Krabi. Instead, he drove us around the block so that we could be greeted by several men shouting "Koh Lanta" all up in our grill. We walked away, back to the proper bus station to search out a songthaew that would take us to the pier.

## Sonthaews

A songthaew is sometimes referred to in english as a government bus and sometimes as a shared taxi. Neither really seems to adequately get across what they are.

They look like giant tuk-tuk / van hybrids and will have a loose route that they follow. Along that route I think they take everyone to their specific destinations, unless they've just been taking pity on us idiot foreigners. They seem to always cost 100 baht, regardless of how long you're on.

We wandered around the bus station for a while before a very nice driver picked us up and took us around the corner to where the correct songthaew was parked.

We hopped on, and were accompanied by:

1 middle aged Thai lady
1 old, weed smoking Thai lady
10 trays of eggs
1 sack of rice
1 large canister of petrol, lashed to the outside
30 or so thermite furnaces/ metal melting pots
1 orange mystery sack of mysteries

Amazingly, nothing fell over, smashed, or exploded. The drive to the pier took about an hour, including occasional stops so the driver could make a call, add air to the truck's tires, or exchange an item.

## Ferries

The ferry ride was a delight. It was about 40 mins long, and allowed us to take in the epic, be-jungled islands whilst singing the Jurassic Park theme tune. Well, I sang the Skyrim theme tune, because I can never remember the Jurassic Park one.

## Songthaews (again)

Almost there!

We got to the pier (thankfully the ferry only had one stop, so we knew where to get off), and jumped onto another songthaew. Koh Yao Noi has one road going around its circumference with a few off shoots into the middle, so all songthaews go everywhere. Unless the pity thing was happening again.

We got to our bungalow, drank a Margherita, and fell asleep at 8.
