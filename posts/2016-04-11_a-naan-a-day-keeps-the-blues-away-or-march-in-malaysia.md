# A naan a day keeps the blues away, or March in Malaysia

Been a bit silent on here, sorry. My dad came to visit us in Vietnam, and also I've been lazy. I'll blame the lack of structure to my life and move on.

We decided to spend the first two weeks of our time in Malaysia staying in an apartment in Kuala Lumpur. We figured it would rejuvenate us to have a bit more space of our own, in somewhere more like a home than a hotel.

Kuala Lumpur literally means "muddy confluence". This is the point where the two rivers that give the city it's name join.

It's lucky that we chose to do this as Jack was struck down with an almighty flu for a big portion of our time there, and it was nice to have breathing/convalescing space of our own.

With the help of a course of TammyFlu we still managed to get out and about in the city and see a fair amount.

The main road through Little India in KL

It was a bit of a shock at first, the heat and the size of KL compared to sleepy Laos, and although we did manage to get over the size we never really acclimatised to the heat. We later discovered that Malaysia was in the midst of a heatwave whilst we were there, so it wasn't just us that had a hard time. Man oh man though, not sure I'm on board with the equator. I prefer a healthy glow rather than "did you just go swimmi.... oh, I see" levels of sweat.

It also felt a bit more impersonal that anywhere we'd been before, which was a product of more than just the size. We never really sussed out the identity of the place - it felt like a little bit of everywhere and then no where at all. It also felt much less friendly than other places we've visited, lost of staring and laughing at us which was a bit tiring after a while. Perhaps it was the heat, the flu and the culture shock, but it just wasn't our cup of tea in the end.

That's not to say it was all bad: here's some chat about what we got up to and some photos!

On of the many coffee shops we spent our time in to escape the heat.

## Merdeka square

Merdeka (independence) square is a pretty good starting point to begin understanding the history of KL and Malaysia as a whole. It was the centre of British colonial rule/ where the employees of the British government used to play cricket. As the name suggests it was also where Malaysian independence was declared.

Spot the tudor style cricket house

The buildings that surround the central square, which still looks very much like a cricket green, are a combination of Dutch and British colonial buildings, newer art deco inspired towers, and moorish style buildings. This eclecticism radiates out from the square for a few blocks, also incorporating old Chinese shophouses into the mix, before giving way to bog standard skyscrapers.

Ok, not that standard.

Petronas towers

## City gallery

One of the old colonial buildings on Merdeka square houses the city gallery, which contains an exhibition about the history of Kuala Lumpur. It was a pretty small and sweet exhibition - my favourite part of it was the display of old maps of the city. Old maps are always awesome.

At the end of the exhibition is a pretty hilarious "experience" centred around a model of the city. It's all lights and power point slides basically listing how much things cost to build. A tad mad.

## Islamic art museum

As you may or may not know, Malaysia's main religion is Islam and throughout Kuala Lumpur there are a number of beautiful mosques and other buildings influenced buy different schools of Islamic architecture. Having had a taste of this as we wandered through the city we decided to head to the Islamic Arts Museum, situated within on of the largest parks in the city, to find out more.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xu56j5i164okz4z/IMG_0810.jpg?dl=0)

I loved this museum. It leads you through the development of various types of art (ceramics, architecture, textiles, calligraphy/printing) in the Islamic world generally, and then focuses in on Malaysia specifically.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/hkrzpf5bhlljjqk/IMG_0813.jpg?dl=0)

The exhibitions were very well curated, essentially telling the history of the region through developments in artistic techniques, and the integration of new styles and materials.

My favourite part was the ceramics, closely followed by weaponry. Guns shaped like panthers, jewelled armour, fierce af swords. It was mad, and the idea of coming up against it in battle completely terrifying.

## KL tower

As is my way, I'd entered into a heat based grump on the day that we decided to head over to the KL tower, but it's views (as well as it's breeze) quickly dissipated that. High places with views are our jam.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/rirdu3fn9ma1q92/IMG_0829.jpg?dl=0)

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/hxpn1iv29xfxlt4/IMG_0835.jpg?dl=0)

KL tower is used for communication purposes, and is the seventh tallest freestanding tower in the world. There is a viewing platform at the top and a gift shop. The gift shop is crap, the views are not.

## Eco park

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/y2mz0o5h4uxs6m2/IMG_0826.jpg?dl=0)

In the middle of Kuala Lumpur, there's a rainforest with a series of elevated walkways. There's not much more to say about it really, it was quite a nice little respite away from the buildings, if not the heat.

## Eating all the food

Ok, so the food in Malaysia is just awesome. I ate so much curry and, as the title of this post suggests, naan bread. In the future, when I've installed a tandoori oven in our kitchen, it's Malaysia that Jack will have to blame.

The food on offer is very varied, benefiting from the mix of inhabitants who are of Malay, Chinese, and Indian origin. The cuisine pulls from the repertoire of these countries, and the result is heavenly. I ate some of the best dim sum I've ever had here, fantastic curries, naans, pratha, roti, and daal, delicious nasi lemak.





Also, the tea. So good. Not really tea like in England, in fact, pretty much a travesty when compared: strong, fairly crap black tea, sweetened condensed milk, and sugar. It sounds gross, but it's the best accompaniment to curry ever invented. If you've ever had warm assam bubble tea, it's like that but without the bubble. If you haven't, do yourself a huge favour and go get some.

Cameron Highlands

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0m5hwdx6sslbcoi/IMG_0921.jpg?dl=0)

On our first full day there we decided to take a half day tour which would include some tea plantations and an area called the mossy forest.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/mtygmha8v96g0yu/IMG_0924.jpg?dl=0)

Tea!



The main plantation in the area is owned by Boh, which is a Scottish ran tea company that I'd not heard of before. According to our guide, who was from a tour company not the plantation, the tea itself is not particularly great, as they tend towards a later harvest when the tea leaves are bigger, but more brittle and less flavoursome. It's also grown at a much lower altitude than the higher quality tea from China and India.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wby3k76elkjdjiv/IMG_0943.jpg?dl=0)

The tea is harvested mainly by immigrants from Laos, Bangladesh and Vietnam, who are paid around $0.25 per kilo of leaves that they pick. They, pretty understandably, prefer methods of harvesting that get the most leaves picked per day and therefore tend to use a machine, rather than hand picking. The machine is dragged down the bushes, cutting anything in it's way into an attached bag. Again understandably, they're not too picky when sorting through the harvested leaves at the end of the day, as more stuff = more weight = minutely more money. This added to the strikes our guide drew up against the quality of Boh's tea.

Although the poor pay left a bad taste in my mouth, it was pretty hard to deny the manicured beauty of the rolling hills covered in the small tea bushes.

See!

After the tea plantation, we headed to an area known as the mossy forest. The forest, as the name suggests, is covered in moss and is a unique habitat for a range of flora, although weirdly lacking in animals. It has only been recently re-opened to the public after too many people straying from the designated walking routes destroyed vast quantities of the moss that covers, or used to cover, every surface within the forest.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/87u4fhzfvubad6c/IMG_0991.jpg?dl=0)

The elevated boardwalk now open to the public allows you to look without touching. This re-opening was negotiated by the tour operators in the area, who claimed that the closing of the forest had a detrimental impact on their business.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.comm/s/35eb6s4ssfz2zia/IMG_1010.jpg?dl=0)

The forest was used as part of the set for Avatar, and once inside it's not hard to see why. There's something discreetly magical about the vibrant green moss and woody grottos that exist slightly out of reach. The pratting about of others on the walk only slightly dampens the effect.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ydm911icj84rqfs/IMG_1035.jpg?dl=0)

After our tour ended, we walked from it's point of completion back to Tanah Rata a couple of miles away. The Cameron Highlands is laced with numbered walking routes of varying difficulty - this was the fairly easy number 4.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/hlix6xbyva227ed/IMG_1060.jpg?dl=0)

Waterfall near the end of route 4.

The next day we were up for a bit of a challenge, so headed out to conquer route 10, up Gunung Jasar. The route began not far from our hostel, in "Tan's Camelia Garden" which is essentially the back garden of a local guy, named Tan, who likes camelias.

The climb was devastating, even with the added fitness that we'd gained in Laos. It took about 1.5 hours to reach the top and was an unrelenting climb over tangled tree roots the whole way. There was another group of travellers fairly close behind and my pride wouldn't allow them to overtake us, so we all but collapsed at the top.

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ae3wqf6pf3ioygr/IMG_1083.jpg?dl=0)

As usual, the view was a fantastic reward (although there was an even better one at the bottom).

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f5wicdt649o6qy4/IMG_1067.jpg?dl=0)

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/auncf1u48183o1q/IMG_1087.jpg?dl=0)

As we headed back down the mountain we realised that we'd completely underestimated the amount of water needed for the day. Although it was, mercifully, much cooler than KL it was still in the mid 20s and the walk was tough. As we reached the bottom of the mountain, and with a few miles still to go before getting back to town, we were shrivelling up.

And then we saw it. Surely a mirage, we thought to ourselves. But as we got closer there was no denying the tudor style, very English, countryside pub before us.

They didn't have a decent pint, but they had something far better. My awkwardness at such a blatant artifact of colonialism was pushed aside to mull over another day as I sunk my teeth into one of the best cream teas I've ever eaten.
