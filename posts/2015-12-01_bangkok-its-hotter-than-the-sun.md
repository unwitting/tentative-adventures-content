# Bangkok: it's hotter than the sun

When we finished our epic journey from Coventry to Bangkok, via London and Oslo, over the course of 48 hours we pretty much just wanted to get to bed immediately. What we actually did, however, was take the train to the centre of town and then walk the remaining distance, in the mid-day heat, to our hostel. It was only three blocks, but either the scale of things is just different here or the heat seriously messes with your sense of distance because it felt about four times longer. Lesson learned.

The view from the plane as we landed in Thailand

We’ve got eight days here so we’ve been taking it at a pretty chilled out pace, allowing ourselves to get used to the heat, the food, our new life (!). After the death heat walk mentioned above, we’ve tried to avoid being outside for the middle section of the day and tend to head to air conditioning.

Either side of this we've alternated between just wandering around different parts of town, and heading to specific monuments/temples/sights. And eating.

Lumpini park was one of the recommendations in the epic dossier on Thailand that a friend from work sent to me. It's a calm park with a couple of small lakes, which is a nice place to relax away from the crowds. There were a surprising number of absolutely mad people running and cycling around it in the baking heat.

Their glassy, sterile look contrasts quite starkly to the average Bangkok street, and many of them contain floors of high end brands (your Pradas, your Chanels, your Maseratis). This, and the growth in number of these behemoths in recent years, points to a rise in aspirational middle class inhabitants of the city. Very brief research suggests this is the case, (linked to a rise in university attendance and in foreign companies setting up base here, etc, etc).

Anyway, I'm not so sure this accounts for all of their quantity and popularity, or their contrast to other parts of the city. The only place that I have seen brand shops (both local and international) that aren't market stalls is in these malls. Given the heat, Bangkok-ians seem to prefer to do their shopping in a temperature regulated mall, rather than having to pop in and out of shops along a street, melting as they go. I'm sure some of them are also just using the mall like we are: as an AC haven from their day.

Related to this: the energy usage of many of these malls is higher than whole Thai provinces. Have a graph:

Get a grip Siam Paragon.

Ok, so these regions have pretty small populations, but still, madness.

Coconut ice cream!! The only ice cream I've had so far... :(

This morning Jack and I woke up very early so that we could get the first boat of the day, travelling with students and commuters up to the old town. We wanted to see the sun rise onto Wat Arun, or the Temple of Dawn.

As it was still very early we decided to make the most of the "cool" weather and stroll around the sights. We found ourselves in the midst of bustling morning trade, where vendors were selling huge piles of veg to (presumably) restauranteurs and street food cooks.

It's probably the most fun I've had so far. We couldn't get pictures of the busiest areas for fear of being trampled/mown down by motorbikes, but I was happy to just soak it all in.

Food carts were firing up for the breakfast trade, tables of flowers were being arranged, motorbikes piled with alarming amounts of produce were weaving through the pedestrians. Monks from all of the local temples were walking through the streets in their bright orange robes collecting ingredients for their daily meal, occasionally stopping for prayers with individuals who presented them with offerings of food or orchids.

We went back to the same area three hours later and all of the locals, and their stalls, had been replaced with tourists. We've made a mental note to get up early more often.

We then headed to Wat Saket, or The Golden Mount, which is a temple built on top of an artificial hill. It was essentially empty when we got there, and offered pretty epic views across the city.

After this I pretty much died. See: the heat.
