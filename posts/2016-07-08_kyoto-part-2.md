# Kyoto: Part 2

So, I'm going to say it: I don't like Japanese food. It's boring.

Japan has the highest number of Michelin starred restaurants of any country in the world. Ok, fine. But. In every other place we've been, almost every meal we've eaten has given me some sort of culinary epiphany. It's been varied and interesting, liberally spiced and, well, incredible.

Here it seems that everything is so carefully and delicately balanced you come away with food that tastes like slightly fragrant air. The texture of fresh sushi is nice but ultimately, it's just unflavoured raw fish, so fresh it doesn't even taste like fish. Is this blasphemy? Am I just uncultured?

Look, endless bowls of noodles with lightly seasoned broth would be fine if I'd just spent a week indulging on rich foods, but mainly I've been eating them after a week of similarly bland bowls of noodles.

I once tried to buy a chilli so that I, at least, could cook up something with a bit of punch. But could I find one? China is right there!! You can not tell me that in this globalised world a country as modern as Japan doesn't have the means to import chillies 10 meters across the sea. It's madness!!! After months of eating cheap, delicious, incredibly tasty food it's galling to pay 1 billion pounds (plus 10% now - thanks Brexit) for a bowl of something I can barely taste.

Sorry Japan.

Not to be brought down by this disastrous revelation, I've readjusted my travel goals from 90% food based, to 90% garden based. It's working well.

## Nijo Castle

Yes, another castle. Nijo-jo pretty much means castle of second street / second street castle. To be honest, I wish Jack would stop translating everything because the names of sites always turn out to be really boring in English.

This castle was right next to our apartment, but we didn't get around to visiting until the last couple of days of our time there. The grounds are quite big, but the structure itself isn't as interesting as others we've been to. The best part of Nijo was the gardens. I'm assuming that when the castle was actually in use as a defensive structure there weren't as many gardens, especially as Nijo was mainly used as a sort of military camp.

I've been reading up on Japanese pruning techniques recently, because I live for the thrills. You've probably noticed the strange shapes of the trees in my previous photos of Japan, and there are more examples of this below. Ornamental gardens in Japan tend to use fewer types of trees than you might find in the UK. To create the ambiance they want from a garden, gardeners in Japan sculpt this limited set of trees using a set of pruning techniques, collectively known as Niwaki (庭木 - this also means "garden trees"). Trees are often made to look gnarled, windswept, or even as if they have been struck by lightning.

These trees are surrounded by moss, rocks and streams, symbolising / mimicking nature on a small scale. The result is a garden whose appeal comes from the particular arrangement and shape of trees and the small details that surround them, rather than from variety. They tend to be very tranquil spaces, even when busy.

## Fushimi Inari Shrine

If you google "Japan", you'll probably see a picture of this shrine's vast number of torii gates high up on the results list.

This shrine is dedicated to the spirit Inari, who is the god of rice, as well as the patron of business and industry. The torii gates that line the paths weaving up the mountain have been placed there mainly by businesses as a donation or offering to Inari. Scattered throughout the shrine there are a number of fox statues, as foxes are the messengers of Inari.

It was quite busy when we visited the shrine, but the crowds thinned out the higher up the mountain we walked.

This is *the* picture of Japan. If you travel here and don't take it you get your passport revoked. Probably.

## Ginkaku-ji

Last time we came to Kyoto we visited Kinkaku-ji (Golden Temple) on one of the only rainy days of our holiday. We headed to the Silver Temple on a similarly rainy day.

As usual, the gardens were the best part of this temple complex. It was fairly small, but had a number of lovely water features and was carpeted in vibrant green moss. I swear leaves, grass and other greenery are more saturated here than any other country I've been to. I'm not sure if its the rain and general humidity, or perhaps just an optical illusion, but it makes these sorts of mossy landscapes feel slightly magical.

## Nara

At the end of June we took a day trip to Nara, a small town about an hour out of Kyoto. We were lured there by promises of deer and we were not disappointed. Watching school kids in their sailor-like uniforms petting stags on their way to school was like being in a Miyazaki film.

There's not a huge amount to do in Nara. There's essentially a park containing a couple of temples and the aforementioned deer. There's the inevitable covered market. And that's about it. Still, it was a gorgeous day, so wandering the quiet streets and lounging in the park was lovely.

## Osaka

Kyoto is separated from Osaka by a line of mountains that briefly give way to allow a slim line of suburbs to connect the two. They are, in effect, the same metropolitan area, but on the ground they couldn't feel more different.

In contrast to Kyoto's temples and geisha, Osaka's main draw is a high street full of multi-story shops. We spent an afternoon wandering between these and the river that cuts through the city, enjoying the bright lights and loud noises. Every now and then, though, you turn a corner to find a small shrine sitting, somehow, in a bubble of silence.

The day that we spent in Osaka was fun, but exhausting. I much prefer the tranquility of its sister city.

## Romantic train

The Sagano Romantic Railway is a short stretch of track that runs West from Kyoto's Arishiyama suburb. Having been replaced as a functional transportation line by a track running under the mountains, this river hugging line offers 20 minute trips for tourists. We decided to go mainly because of its name, and didn't regret it.

Arashimaya is an attraction in its own right, which contains a number of pretty temples and a bamboo forest. Whilst we decided to skip the temples we did take a stroll through the bamboo. It was another one of those places that if you google looks beautiful and isolated but is in fact jam packed with people. It was still a pretty fun place to be, especially when the wind picked up, making the grass creak as it swayed.
