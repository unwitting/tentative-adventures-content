# Flying visit to Ayutthaya

On our way up to Chiang Mai from Bangkok we decided to have a two night stop over in Ayutthaya, the old capital of the Kingdom of Siam.

A bit about Ayutthaya

Ayutthaya was founded in around 1350, becoming the second capital of the Kingdom of Siam after Sukhothai, which is further north.

In the late 1600s Ayutthaya had a population of about one million, making it the most populous city at the time. In contrast, London's population was about half that.

The Burmese army attacked the city in 1767, at the end of the Burmese-Siamese war. The city was sacked, leaving the ruins that still cover the central island, and bringing the Siamese Kingdom to an end.

Many visitors, though, are unaware of this history and make the pilgrimage to Ayutthaya because it is the setting for the training montage in the Van Damme film Kickboxer.



(Please also now watch the video of Van Damme dancing in this film. It's one of his finest moments. In fact, just watch the whole film.)

## Our visit

For the two nights that we were there we stayed in a lovely teak guesthouse in the south of the city called Thaihouse The Riverfront. It's run by a local lady, with "help" from her 2 year old granddaughter Tuki. Tuki showed us to our room when we arrived, practiced her english with us throughout the stay - "my name is Tuki!" was her favourite line - and then asked if she could come with us when we left. She was incredibly cute. Yes, was my answer.

Our visit coincided with the annual festival celebrating the city being named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We hadn't planned this at all (in fact, we've developed a bit of a habit of turning up to towns just after a major festival or celebration has finished), but it was lovely to see the locals in full celebration mode.

The temples themselves were pretty interesting (although, as usual, there are only so many I can handle in a short space of time). Although a lot of the statues are missing parts, walls are crumbling and whole towers have gone awol, you really get a sense of the grandeur of Ayutthaya in its height. The city was quite a key trading point for many European merchants, particularly from France and the Netherlands, and it's not hard to imagine why many were enamoured with the place.

In the pictures you often see online, and in the Kickboxer montage, it always looks like the ruins are out in the middle of nowhere. Some of the most iconic shots, such as the Buddha head in the roots of a tree, suggest that whoever took it happened upon them during some daring exploration.

In reality the Buddha head is in the most popular temple, and was surrounded by selfie taking tourists of all nationalities the whole time we were there. The biggest complexes of ruins are in the middle of a bustling city, and can often be seen poking out from behind industrial buildings. It's a shame this isn't more obvious in photos of the place, because I think it actually enhances its charm.

The food that we had in Ayutthaya was pretty strong. The area is known for two dishes: Roti sai mai and boat noodles. Roti sai mai is essentially a crepe full of candy floss. It rocks. The candy floss is made from spun coconut sugar, and has a texture a bit like human hair. Which is not appetising. But once you wrap it up in the roti, it's pretty easy to get over that weirdness because, well, it's just sugar. Delicious sugar. It comes in a range of flavours - we tried original and strawberry. Also, the roti are green.

Boat noodles is a dish containing pork, vegetables, offal, noodles, and a rich soup that is thickened with pork blood. They're called boat noodles because they used to be served from boats... You seem to be able to get them everywhere in Thailand, but it's claimed that they originated here. By the way, if you ever see a restaurant styled like a boat or built into an old boat, it's because they serve boat noodles and not just some quirky Thai design choice.

On our second day in the city we also bought some of the most delicious pork belly in the world. I'm a pretty big belly pork fan. Delicious meat, delicious fat, delicious skin, delicious deliciousness. As we walked along the market stalls I got a glimpse of its reddy/orange goodness from pretty far away and all but ran to it. We bought 100 grams and snarfed it in about two minutes flat. I can only assume that voodoo was used to get the skin as crackley as it was.
