# Month one: A review

We've been out in Thailand for a whole month. It feels both longer and shorter somehow. I've been impressed by how quickly we've settled into this life - not the not working part, I knew we'd take to that very quickly ... I expected a lot more teething pains with eating, getting around, etc than we've had. So, yay for us.

Some stats about this month:

* Miles travelled: 7387
* Places: 6 (Bangkok x 2, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Surat Thani, Koh Yao Noi, Ayutthaya, Chiang Mai)
* Bus journeys: 2
* Train journeys: 3
* Flights: 3
* Average daily temperature: 30.5 degrees C
* Bouts of homesickness: 1
* Marriage de-stabilising incidents: 1 (see, the capsizing)

### Some of Kate's favourites:

Meal - The roast pork we had in Ayutthaya. My God. That crackling. We bought 100 grams and just ate it straight from the bag. It was fantastic.

### Some of Jack's favourites:

Meal - The yellow rice and fried chicken we bought from a street vendor in Ayutthaya. We were starving, and it was perfect.
