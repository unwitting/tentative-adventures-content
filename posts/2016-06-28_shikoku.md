# Shikoku 四国

The past 8 months have been an exercise in budgetary marginal gains often at the expense of sleep. Thus, we took an early morning flight from Shanghai to the small Japanese island of Shikoku, rather than Osaka or Tokyo, to save ourselves about £20. Score.

We arrived at Takamatsu airport after a short, uneventful plane journey ready for the final part of our Asian adventure. As happens at every new country, we waited in the border control queue full of anxiety that we'd read the entry requirements wrong. Due to some language-barrier based confusion we ended up at the back of the queue but were let through the border without too much trouble.

Now, it might be that being the only westerners on a plane from Shanghai to this rando town made us suspicious. Or, it made us interesting and exciting. I suspect it was a little of both. Whatever the reason, as we began to walk through customs we were very politely asked "can we search your bags?"

I've never head my bags searched in an airport before, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't usually go like this. We were taken into a small room by two very friendly customs officers, who proceeded to ask us fairly standard questions about our travels, with pretty non-standard levels of enthusiasm. When Jack replied with a little Japanese the excitement intensified. After a good 15 minutes of chit chat, they remembered why we were there and abashedly asked to look through our belongings, apologising profusely the whole time.

After finding nothing more incriminating than a baggie of Sichuan pepper they bowed us out of the room, smiling and thanking us the entire time. It was the perfect Japanese "welcome back".

## Takamatsu 高松

Having managed to extricate ourselves from the customs officials' conversation, we headed to the exit - we knew that somewhere near the airport was a bus we could catch into the centre. Luckily, rumours of our arrival seemed to have reached the lobby before us. We were chased down by a handful of airport staff and escorted 5 meters to the bus driver, who was to be our shepherd for the remaining 7 meters to the bus itself.

When we finally arrived at the centre, we were welcomed by this delightful train station:

Although Takamatsu is the prefecture capital it's a very small, quiet town. In terms of sites and activities, it has a mostly destroyed castle, a huge and lovely garden, an undercover market, and that's about it. We spent two days wandering around these sights, and generally soaking up the chill atmosphere. Here's some photos:

This area is known for its Udon, which we ended eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner almost every day.

Our hotel room. We were the only guests.

### Ritsurin gardens 栗林公園

Ritsurin gardens is one of the most famous historical gardens in Japan, which is saying something. If there's one thing Japan has a lot of, it's gardens. The construction of Ritsurin began in 1625 by the feudal lord of that time, so a pretty standard genesis story as far as Japanese gardens go. As is also standard for pretty much any historical building and/or garden here, it was requisitioned by the Meji government in the late 1800s who then made into a public park. In the 1950s it was designated as a Special Place of Scenic Beauty, which is a status similar to our national parks and heritage gardens.

By the way, if your interested in a quick guide to Japanese history, then I recommend watching this video. It's funny, cutting, and also informative!

## Matsuyama 松山

Following our time in Takamatsu we travelled west to Matsuyama, the biggest city on Shikoku. Still pretty sleepy and with even fewer touristy sites than Takamatsu, but lovely all the same. The castle was its most interesting site, as it was much larger and more complete than the Takamatsu one. It was accessible by an incredibly serene chairlift, from which you were treated to a pretty good view of the town.

Matsuyama was also where Jack got into the swing of practising his Japanese, which landed us in a number of long conversations with shop owners that we probably wouldn't have otherwise had. It also scored us some free cream puffs after a particularly delightful exchange with a local baker near our hotel.

Oh yes, the hotel... Japan is pretty expensive. We haven't been able to find any of the slightly grotty but very cheap places to stay that have characterised the rest of our trip. Instead of hovering around £15 a night here it's been more like £30 which seriously cuts into our daily budget. In Takamatsu the only affordable place we could find was a 10 person dorm, pictured above, that we ended up having all to our selves. In Matsuyama, the most affordable place to stay turned out to be a love hotel.

Ho ho ho. It was tacky, slightly disturbing, and hilarious. There were catalogues of escorts available to order. A vending machine full of cheap looking lingerie. Various light settings, including one that was all purple. A karaoke machine. TV channels to suit every taste... You get the picture. When I spied other hotel guests they mainly seemed to be sheepish looking 20-something couples, but the membership available for this chain of hotels was definitely aimed at businessmen. I'm not really sure how these hotels are viewed by the general populace, but the one we stayed in seemed pretty popular.

It was hilarious once, but from now one I'd rather pay a bit more to stay somewhere less... purple.

This diorama was above the jacuzzi in our hotel room. Why? Because Japan I guess

Not a product from our hotel room. We decided to try a few Japanese sweets from the local "combini". This is an ice cream, shaped like an egg, wrapped in plastic. Why? Because Japan. (Btw, combini is short for/a loan word referring to combinience store. Why? Because American occupation)

### Matsuyama Castle

This castle was built in 1603, and added to by a succession of lords. It has a really clever layout that's clear once you're up in the keep, but very confusing when you're first entering its grounds. It's particularly famous for the series of gates which lured attacking forces into courtyards that were surrounded on all sides by convenient arrow firing locations.

Having somehow survived the mass destruction of castles that took place in the Meiji era, it was partially damaged during WW2. Restoration then began in the 60s, and is pretty much complete now.

## Staying put

After a week on Shikoku we took a night bus from Matsuyama to Kyoto (another sleep depriving money saver). We decided to rent a small apartment for a month, partly to save some money, partly to catch our breath after 6 months of moving around, but mostly because we love Kyoto.

Half of our very small apartment!
