# Hiroshima and Gifu

Today marks 8 months since we left the UK. We have a little over a week left. There have been peaks and troughs of how settled we've been in this nomadic lifestyle, but only for the past month or so has it begun to feel normal not to stay still. I'm excited about coming home, but also completely terrified. Far more so than about leaving, in fact.

## Hiroshima

We've had a bit of trouble figuring out where to go in our final month of travel. In most of the countries we've visited there have been several places we've definitely wanted to visit, meaning that a route sort of drew itself. In Japan that's not really been the case. We ended up deciding on a meandering route through the Japanese alps from Kyoto to Tokyo, but before reaching that decision we went through 1001 other options, spidering out into almost all of the islands at some point or another.

The only exception to this was Hiroshima, which we were both really interested in visiting from the start. Faced with the decision between a £75, 2 hour bullet train, or a £30, 8 hour night bus we chose the latter. We arrived in Hiroshima, slightly dishevelled, at the ungodly time of 6:30am.

By the way, anyone who has lived with me for even a short amount of time knows that I have never been able to get my arse out of bed in the morning. You can imagine how much worse I am now, after 8 months of pandering to my sleepiest self. Re-integrating into normal life is going to be tough.

### Peace Memorial Park

The peace memorial park is what you'd imagine:  a park full of monuments to those killed and affected by the A-bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. The most famous part of the park is the "A-bomb dome" or the former Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. This was the building closest to the centre of the explosion but received remarkably little damage mainly because its dome was hit from above and the walls were able to absorb much of the stress of the explosion.

The dome is at the opposite end of the park from the main entrance. The cenotaph that is the first monument you come across after entering frames the dome perfectly, giving the tribute a perpetual reference to the destruction of the bomb and ultimate resilience of Hiroshima's inhabitants.

Much closer to the dome is the Children's Peace Monument which was, for me at least, the most moving part of the park.

In 1955 a young girl named Sadako Sasaki died of leukemia in the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital. She had been two at the time of the bomb but had escaped with no apparent injuries. As with many residents who were not outwardly harmed during the time of the explosion, the damage it caused her became apparent years later.

During her illness another patient at the hospital recounted an old Japanese legend which said that anyone who folded 1000 paper cranes would be granted a wish. She began folding cranes with whatever paper she could find and by the time of her death had made around 1400, with which she was buried. After her death, classmates and friends began petitioning the local government to create a monument for all of the children who had died as a result of the nuclear explosion and radiation. In 1958 the Children's Peace Monument was revealed, on top of which is a girl holding a golden origami crane.

Surrounding this monument were huge cases full of cranes that have been brought to the site by school children.

### Peace Memorial Museum

I'm not sure what the best way to describe the museum is. Unrelenting, perhaps. There were the factual descriptions of what happened and how: the number of deaths; the radius of destruction; how atomic bombs work; the effect of different quantities of radiation on the human body; the maximum temperature of the fireball that was created milliseconds after the explosion.

The most devastating part, though, were the cabinets full of scraps of clothing, shoes, identity cards, fingernails, and bones of those who were killed, along with a brief description of their owner's death. Many of these objects were from children aged 12-14 who had been working at one of the demolition sites in the area, creating fire barriers as protection against incendiary bombs. Behind these items were pictures of men, women and children charred black by fifth degree burns.

### Miyajima

There's no easy way to transition from the horrors of nuclear bombs to a fun day at the beach, but here we are.

The other main attraction in Hiroshima is the island of Miyajima, or "temple island". It is pretty much what it says on the tin. The most famous image of the island is the huge torii gate on the beach. We were there at low tide so could easily walk out to the gate and inspect it up close.

Other than that, there's not a whole lot to do on Miyajima. It's a very sleepy beach town, with a couple of cool little cafes. In fact, Hiroshima was surprisingly full of cool little cafes that transformed in to bars/music venues at night.

Can I just take a moment to talk about the birds of Japan? I'm seriously considering becoming a bird nerd. I just didn't realise they could be so cool. Japan is full of birds of prey, really massive crows, tiny little fluttery ones, and lots of fresh-water fishing birds. Apart from the crows I have no idea what most of the birds even are (hence 'tiny little fluttery ones'), but I must have spent hours watching them fish, hunt, and eat food from the hands of old Japanese men. We don't have any good pictures of them really, because we don't have a lens that's up to it, but you can spot a few in the sky of some of the shots below.

## Gifu

After a couple of days in Hiroshima, we hopped back onto an overnight bus and headed back to Kyoto, where we then caught a train up to Gifu. A fairly small town, despite being a prefecture capital, Gifu is essentially known for two things: its castle and cormorant fishing.

### Gifu castle

Yes, another castle! After this one I was pretty much over castles and we haven't been to another since. To be fair, Gifu castle is particularly important because it was the one time home of everyone's favourite daimyo, Oda Nobunaga.

No? It's this guy:

Nobunaga was instrumental in the unification of the warring micro-states of Japan in the 16th century, and was one of the three key figures behind the founding of the Shogunate. His successful subjugation of the main island of Japan, Honshu, paved the way for his ally, Tokugawa, to establish the Shogunate in 1603 after Nobunaga had died.

I've been slowly getting to grips with the timeline of Japanese history since we arrived, but it still gets pretty jumbled in my mind. Their medieval period was much longer than ours, lasting well into the 1800s, and its earlier phase in which Japan was fragmented into many, many states all has a huge number of important figures, capitals and battles to get your head around. This period is also why there are so many bloody castles.

Gifu castle was a fun one for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it's reached by a ropeway/cablecar. Secondly, it's full of shurikens. See:

### Cormorant fishing

After a few hours wandering around the castle and its grounds we headed to the river to witness the other tourist attraction Gifu has to offer: cormorant fishing.

This is a cormorant:

![](/content/images/2016/07/cormorant_icon.jpg)

Fishing with said bird pretty much involves lobbing it into the water and letting it swim around until it catches a fish. Each bird has a ring around its neck that means it can't swallow big fish. Instead, these fish get stored in the some sort of throat pocket.

Cormorant fishing happens every night for a couple of months over summer. It's conducted by 6 fishermen, each of whom have a contract with the Emperor for fish which is passed down from generation to generation. The actual catching of the fish isn't really the point. The spectacle is the point.

There are two ways to watch the fishing. The free option, and the one we chose, is to watch from the riverbank. The second is to book onto a boat that will float on the edge of the river during the display.

We headed to the river as the sun began to set and sat with a handful of others in the warmth, waiting until darkness. Just as the last tinges of lilac left the sky six boats began advancing down the river towards us, each with a huge ball of flames hanging at the bow. It was difficult to see the 12 birds swimming in front of each boat, partly because they were dipping under the water, and partly because it involved staring pretty much directly into the aforementioned ball of flames.

The whole thing didn't last particularly long, and the fishing was a little underwhelming. Still, it was pretty place to spend the evening.

(It was unclear how the fish were retrieved post spectacle.)
