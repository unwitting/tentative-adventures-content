# Hong Kong

I enjoyed South-East Asia but lets be real, East Asia is my jam.

We headed over to Hong Kong after our stint in Vietnam and we essentially ate ourselves into a stupor. Guys, the food is In. Sane. More about that later, but be warned: there's a lot of food pictures in this post. If you don't have access to roast goose, then I don't recommend looking at these pictures whilst hungry.

I feel like it was in Hong Kong where we settled much more into the lifestyle that we thought we'd have whilst travelling, which is to say each day being a mix of a little sightseeing and a whole lot of learning/reading/making. It's taken a while to get to this point mostly, I think, because at first we wanted to make sure we saw as much as possible in each place and tired ourselves out doing so. Now we've realised that the places we've loved have been the ones where we just tried to get a feel for living day to day, rather than worry too much about the "must-sees". We're trying to do that more consciously now, rather than just accidentally doing it some of the time.

Here's some chat about what we got up to when we weren't hunched over our laptops:

## Chungking Mansions

Spoiler alert: The "mansions" part is ironic.

Hong Kong is expensive. And there's lots to eat (see below) and do, so we found it pretty hard to reign in our spending. In fact, I've just looked over our finances and can confirm that we failed miserably at restraining ourselves in HK.

One way in which we saved a small amount was by staying in Chunking Mansions (although it still ended up being one of the most expensive non-treat accommodations). We were warned that we might die etc, etc, but apart from the fact that the room was only 7 meters squared, and that you get harangued constantly by men on the bottom floor trying to sell "copy watches" (and drugs), it wasn't too bad.

We stayed on the 17th floor, which had an access stairway to the roof where we spent some time chilling away form the hustle and bustle, and taking photos.

## Wandering around

When we wanted a rest from our laptop-based activities, we tended to just go out for an aimless wander. Although there's a grey haze that covers the city, it overcomes this and manages to be a pretty bright and colourful place. There are lots of streets that look like the Hong Kong of movies, all bright neon signs hanging over the road, and I found it hard not to photograph every one of them.

As a city it was nowhere near as hectic as Hanoi, but in many ways it felt more full of life, abundant with markets, street stalls, high end bars and cheap hole in the wall eateries. It seemed like a place where old and new manage to exist side by side, complementing each other and creating a city unlike any other I've been to.

This is, of course, idolising it in a way that's easy for a fly by visitor. I'm sure Hong Kong is as rife with issues as any country in the world (for one, its relationship with mainland China is... [tense](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36309063)), but for the time we were there it was perfect.

## Sai Kung and a seafood feast

Jack's brother in-law (my brother in-law? Is that how that works?? Not sure about the naming, but you get the picture) has family in Hong Kong who we met up with twice during our time there.

The first time we hung out we went to Sai Kung, a small town on the mainland of Hong Kong. When we arrived we took some time to wander around the fish market. It was pretty fun to watch, boats laden with fish floated in the water attached by a ladder and rope to the pier. The people buying fish shouted their order down to the sellers, who then passed the seafood up in a huge net. If the buyer was happy, they passed the money back down using the net.

Later in the afternoon we headed to one of the seafood restaurants that lined the sea front. Now, I'm usually not a big seafood fan but my god. We had lobster, and clams, and scallops, and prawns, and the hugest platter of sashimi I have ever seen. It was all incredibly fresh and so delicious.

## Hong Kong BBQ

A couple of nights before we left, Jack and I met up with the fam once more, this time to hit up a BBQ joint. Delicious meats, good chat, hot coals. Good times. Except, early on in the evening the fire spat a little piece of coal down my top because fuck me right? I now have a really ugly scar on my tit.

After some burn cream had been applied, and a greater distance from the fire established the merriment continued. It was pretty fun roasting meat over the fire, surrounded by countless other huge groups doing the same. We even got treated to a meat cooking demonstration by the owner of the BBQ.

These two outings were the best parts of our trip: we visited places we certainly wouldn't have visited on our own and with excellent company!

## All of the food

As I mentioned above, we ate a lot of good food in Hong Kong - similar to British take-away fare it ain't. There are over 60 restaurants in Hong Kong with at least 1 Michelin star, and we would have been silly not to sample a few.

However, lets start with something gross:

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/sucrsgax0dvmjbz/IMG_2504.jpg?dl=0)

This is macaroni soup. It was Jack's. He assures me it was nice but just look at it.

[IG image] Egg tarts are all the rage it seems, and they have been all over Asia. In Bangkok there was a egg tart shop that always had an hour long queue and a tart buying limit. I'm not sure what the big deal is, they're fine I guess... This one had a custard that was a little overly sweet for my liking.

[IG image] The food I was most looking forward to was this delicious bad boy: crispy belly pork. I may have mentioned it in a few of my other posts... In the future I'm going to have to refer to this time period as "that year I only ate belly pork". Although, I'll be pretty sad if this trend doesn't continue beyond the travel.

Anyway, we ate this particular version at the airport when we arrived in Honk Kong, because why wait? The fat was fatty, the pork was porky, the skin was crispy. It was perfect.

This is a doughnut. A s'more doughnut. Note the delicious caramelisation of the marshmallow. We got this from a small shop called Munchies in Sheung Wen on Hong Kong island. Sheung Wen is very much the Shoreditch of HK, which probably goes without saying given the look of this doughnut.

Egg waffles!!! These were delicious. They're pretty much just waffles shaped like tiny eggs, which is an important feature as it turns waffles into something that's socially acceptable to eat as a street snack.

This is roast goose. The holy grail of bird based foods. It's crispy skinned, fat laden gloriousness. We had roast goose three times, which was a bit of a mistake because it's essentially the richest food in the world. All of the goose we ate came from Michelin starred restaurants because we is fancy like that.

After an evening of rich foods the perfect breakfast the next morning was always beef brisket noodles. It's pretty much what it sounds like - slow cooked beef with egg noodles and a clear broth.

## Science museum

We got a little taste of home when we visited the Science Museum, as the main exhibition was on loan from the Science Museum in London. It was about the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

Although we both already knew quite a bit about the LHC (Jack even visited whilst it was still in construction), it was still a really fun and informative exhibition. Along with explaining the physics of how it works, and the importance of the discoveries made using it, the exhibition included some pretty Jules Verne-esque models of its various parts.

## The beach

Turns out, Hong Kong isn't just one sprawling megalopolis consisting of only city. I had it in mind as the Coruscant of Asi. But no! It has national parks and mountains and beaches and all kinds of cool, non-building stuff.

We took the bus out to Deep Water Bay on the south coast of Hong Kong Island on our penultimate day there. Deep Water was a lovely, quiet beach used mainly by the local aged population for exercising. From there we wandered around the coast to the much larger Repulse Bay. This beach was literally teeming with mainland Chinese tourists. It was quite fun to watch the mayhem, but much nicer once they'd got on their buses and the beach was left for us alone.

## Victoria Peak

On the penultimate day of our time in Hong Kong we finally made it up the peak. We'd delayed it for two reasons: 1. we're lazy, and 2. it was really foggy. It's a good thing we did wait as the day we finally made it was one of the clearest we had whilst in the city.

You can walk up the hill, but most take the funicular up and we did too. At the top there's a range of shops and viewing platforms, so we grabbed a coffee and spent a couple of hours gazing out at the city we'd come to love over the course of the previous 10 days.
