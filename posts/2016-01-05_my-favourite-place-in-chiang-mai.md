# My favourite place in Chiang Mai

Happy new year all! I hope you all had a lovely time over christmas :)

We've been in Chiang Mai, in the north of Thailand for just over a week. We celebrated christmas here (with an old school friend who now lives here) as well as new year. We stayed in the old city, which is surrounded by a moat, for the first week, then headed out north for the second week (which included two nights in an AMAZING hotel that my colleagues booked for us as a leaving gift).

After a month of travel (and a bout of homesickness over christmas) we needed a bit of recharge, so we haven't actually been doing much here to be honest. Which is fine, because Chiang Mai is a great place to do nothing. It's full of food and coffee shops, so it's been easy for us to spend days eating, sitting, and caffinating ourselves. I also got a massage. Such a hard life.

My favourite place to chill out is in a coffee shop called Clay Studio in The Garden, in the south of the Old City.

The coffee shop is liked with a pottery studio, and is located within a very tranquil walled garden. It's full of plants and trees, which provide enough cover for you to sit outside even at mid-day. What makes it so lovely, though, is that the whole garden is filled with clay statues, pots, tiles and various fragments of art. Some of these are placed carefully amongst the flora, but others seem to have been dumped in piles all over the place.

I'm not sure whether these pieces have been made especially for the coffee shop, or if they tend to be there because they broken and therefore un-sellable by the studio. Either way, it's a pretty nice effect.

As an added bonus, the coffee is good and they make the best peanut sauce of all time.

The other day Jack and I spent an hour or so taking photos, and I thought I'd put some here:
