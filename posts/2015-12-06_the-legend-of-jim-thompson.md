# The legend of Jim Thompson

Hello from Prachuap Khiri Khan! I'll write about our time here (by the beach!!) soon - right now I wanted to share some more photos from Bangkok :)

Towards the end of our time in the capital, Jack and I visited a small museum that we'd seen recommended in several places.

Jim Thompson House is a pretty random, but really interesting, museum in the centre of Bangkok contained within the house built by an American expat, Jim Thompson, in the 1950s.

Thompson came to Bangkok during his time in the US Army at the tail end of the second world war and, according to our lovely tour guide at the museum, fell in love with the country and it's culture.

He returned to Thailand after he had left the armed forces in order to settle permanently. He seemed to quickly make his fortune by exporting Thai silk to the west, which became popular after his company supplied the material for the first stage production of 'The King and I', as well as having samples featured in Vogue.

As his business grew, Thompson decided to build a house across the river from the weavers who produced his silk.
The house is pretty mad - itself an historical artefact, as well as the various tapestries, sculptures and furnishings within it. It is made up of six teak houses that he procured from around Bangkok and the old Thai capital Ayutthaya, took apart, and shipped to the current location.

Traditionally in old Thai houses of this kind each room would be it's own separate building, but Thompson essentially bolted them all together to make one huge, "western style" house.
