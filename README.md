# Tentative Adventures

This is a place to dump the text content of my wife and I's travel blog previously hosted at tentativeadventures.com, sadly lost in a backup-less hardware failure on its Digital Ocean droplet. This is a space to keep the diaries salvaged from Google caches. It doesn't have the pictures (which we haven't lost, fortunately), so some of the text is a bit weird.
